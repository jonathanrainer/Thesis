Question:
- How do we reduce the latency of a call to memory in our system?


Process: 
- Work down the call stack of papers to see if the general ones have any pointers to papers in this specific section
- Read through papers and work out if they need to be discarded or noted (note any good phrases), any additional papers identified add into the search
- Group the papers by type
- Write up section
