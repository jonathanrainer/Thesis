  abstract = {In this paper, we present a new block replacement policy in which we proposed a new efficient algorithm for combining two important policies Least Recently Used (LRU) and Least Frequently Used (LFU). The implementation of the proposed policy is simple. It requires limited calculations to determine the victim block. We proposed our models to implement LRU and LFU policies. The new policy gives each block in cache two weighing values corresponding to LRU and LFU policies. Then a simple algorithm is used to get the overall value for each block. A comprehensive comparison is made between our Policy and LRU, First In First Out (FIFO), V-WAY, and Combined LRU and LFU (CRF) policies. Experimental results show that the LR+5LF replacement policy significantly reduces the number of cache misses. We modified simple scalar simulator version 3 under Linux Ubuntu 9.04 and we used speccpu2000 benchmark to simulate this policy. The results of simulations showed, that giving higher weighing to LFU policy gives this policy best performance characteristics over other policies. Substantial improvement on miss rate was achieved on instruction level 1 cache and at level 2 cache memory.},

  abstract = {The gargantuan uses of web access in various types of applications, such as text, image, audio, and video, across the globe have caused the limitation for service providers to optimally make use of Internet infrastructure. The advance of web proxy/caching has recently been in place to mitigate this phenomenon using the concept of locality and proximity. There exist some traditional caching schemes, such as FIFO, LFU, LRU, and Size, but with key limitations on the precision. On the other hands, soft computing has recently been investigated due to its advantage of high precision. Thus, this paper proposes a novel caching method by integrating these twos. SVM was first used for classification, to divide the caching probability - to be replaced or else. Then, LFU was applied for the actual replacement given new web objects (if cache full); and these are Hybrid LFU-SVM. Its performance is practically confirmed from our intensive evaluation against SVM-LRU and its traditional schemes like LFU and LRU in order of 14\% to 52.3\% and 18\% to 63.2\%, for hit and byte hit rate, respectively, using a standard NLANR dataset.},

  abstract = {The verification complexity of real-time requirements in embedded systems grows exponentially with the number of applications, as resource sharing prevents independent verification using simulation-based approaches. Formal verification is a promising alternative, although its applicability is limited to systems with predictable hardware and software. SDRAM memories are common examples of essential hardware components with unpredictable timing behavior, typically preventing use of formal approaches. A predictable SDRAM controller has been proposed that provides guarantees on bandwidth and latency by dynamically scheduling memory patterns, which are statically computed sequences of SDRAM commands. However, the proposed patterns become increasingly inefficient as memories become faster, making them unsuitable for DDR3 SDRAM. This paper extends the memory pattern concept in two ways. Firstly, we introduce a burst count parameter that enables patterns to have multiple SDRAM bursts per bank, which is required for DDR3 memories to be used efficiently. Secondly, we present a classification of memory pattern sets into four categories based on the combination of patterns that cause worst-case bandwidth and latency to be provided. Bounds on bandwidth and latency are derived that apply to all pattern types and burst counts, as opposed to the single case covered by earlier work. Experimental results show that these extensions are required to support the most efficient pattern sets for many use-cases. We also demonstrate that the burst count parameter increases efficiency in presence of large requests and enables a wider range of real-time requirements to be satisfied.},

Optimal yet unattainable policy would replace cache memory block whose next reference is the farthest away in the future, among all memory blocks present in the set.In our quest for replacement policy as close to optimal as possible, we thoroughly explored the design space of existing replacement mechanisms using SimpleScalar toolset and SPEC CPU2000 benchmark suite, across wide range of cache sizes and organizations. In order to better understand the behavior of different policies, we introduced new measures, such as cumulative distribution of cache hits in the LRU stack. We also dynamically monitored the number of cache misses, per each 100000 instructions.Our results show that the PLRU techniques can approximate and even outperform LRU with much lower complexity, for a wide range of cache organizations. However, a relatively large gap between LRU and optimal replacement policy, of up to 50\%, indicates that new research aimed to close the gap is necessary. The cumulative distribution of cache hits in the LRU stack indicates a very good potential for way prediction using LRU information, since the percentage of hits to the bottom of the LRU stack is relatively high.},

  abstract = {Optimization of the replacement policy used for Shared Last-Level Cache (SLLC) management in a Chip-MultiProcessor (CMP) is critical for avoiding off-chip accesses. Temporal locality, while being exploited by first levels of private cache memories, is only slightly exhibited by the stream of references arriving at the SLLC. Thus, traditional replacement algorithms based on recency are bad choices for governing SLLC replacement. Recent proposals involve SLLC replacement policies that attempt to exploit reuse either by segmenting the replacement list or improving the rereference interval prediction. On the other hand, inclusive SLLCs are commonplace in the CMP market, but the interaction between replacement policy and the enforcement of inclusion has barely been discussed. After analyzing that interaction, this article introduces two simple replacement policies exploiting reuse locality and targeting inclusive SLLCs: Least Recently Reused (LRR) and Not Recently Reused (NRR). NRR has the same implementation cost as NRU, and LRR only adds one bit per line to the LRU cost. After considering reuse locality and its interaction with the invalidations induced by inclusion, the proposals are evaluated by simulating multiprogrammed workloads in an 8-core system with two private cache levels and an SLLC. LRR outperforms LRU by 4.5\% (performing better in 97 out of 100 mixes) and NRR outperforms NRU by 4.2\% (performing better in 99 out of 100 mixes). We also show that our mechanisms outperform rereference interval prediction, a recently proposed SLLC replacement policy and that similar conclusions can be drawn by varying the associativity or the SLLC size.},

Computer systems are rapidly approaching the point at which overall system performance is determined not by the speed of the CPU but by the memory system speed. We present a high performance memory system architecture that overcomes the growing speed disparity between high performance microprocessors and current generation DRAMs. A novel prediction and prefetching technique is combined with a distributed cache architecture to build a high performance memory system. We use a table based prediction scheme with a prediction cache to prefetch data from the on-chip DRAM array to an on-chip SRAM prefetch buffer. By prefetching data we are able to hide the large latency associated with DRAM access and cycle times. Our experiments show that with a small (32 KB) prediction cache we can get an effective main memory access time that is close to the access time of larger secondary caches.},

Experimental results show that the SF-LRU significantly reduces the number of cache misses compared the other two algorithms. Simulation results show that our algorithm can provide a maximum value of approximately 6.3\% improvement in the miss ratio over the LRU algorithm in data cache and approximately 9.3\% improvement in miss ratio in instruction cache. This performance improvement is attributed to the fact that our algorithm provides a second chance to the block that may be deleted according to LRU's rules. This is done by comparing the frequency of the block with the block next to it in the set.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we investigate static probabilistic timing analysis (SPTA) for single processor real-time systems that use a cache with an evict-on-miss random replacement policy. We show that previously published formulae for the probability of a cache hit can produce results that are optimistic and unsound when used to compute probabilistic worst-case execution time (pWCET) distributions. We investigate the correctness, optimality, and precision of different approaches to SPTA for random replacement caches. We prove that one of the previously published formulae for the probability of a cache hit is optimal with respect to the limited information (reuse distance and cache associativity) that it uses. We derive an alternative formulation that makes use of additional information in the form of the number of distinct memory blocks accessed (the stack distance). This provides a complementary lower bound that can be used together with previously published formula to obtain more accurate analysis. We improve upon this joint approach by using extra information about cache contention. To investigate the precision of various approaches to SPTA, we introduce a simple exhaustive method that computes a precise pWCET distribution, albeit at the cost of exponential complexity. We integrate this precise approach, applied to small numbers of frequently accessed memory blocks, with imprecise analysis of other memory blocks, to form a combined approach that improves precision, without significantly increasing complexity. The performance of the various approaches are compared on benchmark programs. We also make comparisons against deterministic analysis of the least recently used replacement policy.},

  abstract = {Future generation computer architectures are endeavoring to achieve high performance without compromise on energy efficiency. In a multiprocessor system, cache miss degrades the performance as the miss penalty scales by an exponential factor across a shared memory system when compared to general purpose processors. This instigates the need for an efficient cache replacement scheme to cater to the data needs of underlying functional units in case of a cache miss. Minimal cache miss improves resource utilization and reduces data movement across the core which in turn contributes to a high performance and lesser power dissipation. Existing replacement policies has several issues when implemented in a heterogeneous multi-core system. The commonly used LRU replacement policy does not offer optimal performance for applications with high dependencies. Motivated by the limitations of the existing algorithms, we propose a hybrid cache replacement policy which combines Least Recently Used (LRU) and Least Frequently Used (LFU) replacement policies. Each cache block has two weighing values corresponding to LRU and LFU policies and a cumulative weight is calculated using these two values. Conducting simulations over wide range of cache sizes and associativity, we show that our proposed approach has shown increased cache hit to miss ratio when compared with LRU and other conventional cache replacement policies.},

  abstract = {Die-stacked DRAM caches are likely to become available in mainstream chips in the near future. DRAM caches are typically used as a last level shared cache behind the traditional hierarchy of on-chip SRAM caches. However, its internal organization differs from traditional caches as it is based on DRAM technology that provides significantly diverse access latencies depending on the state of its internal structures. Accesses that hit in the row-buffer require only one DRAM command and are significantly faster than those that require closing the row-buffer to load a new row to read from. Prior work has focused on maximizing row-buffer locality while maintaining high cache hit ratios. However, past designs do not consider performance problems that may arise due to interleaved accesses from different applications that compete for the shared DRAM resources, nor the different access patterns and locality characteristics that each of these applications may have. In this paper, we first identify performance pathologies that are specific to DRAM caches which arise due to the interference caused by interleaved accesses from multiple cores. We then propose Tidy Cache, a novel DRAM cache design that is able to ameliorate these performance pathologies by dynamically adapting the replacement policy for demanded data. Our performance evaluation results show that our design outperforms the state-of-the-art by 9.2\% for multi-programmed SPEC workloads and by 16.7\% for a set of TPC-H queries, mainly due to significantly better cache miss ratios.},

It is noticed that the Processor remains stalled on memory references. Data Prefetching is a technique that fetches that next instruction's data parallel to the current instruction execution in a typical Processor-Cache-DRAM system. A Prefetcher anticipates a cache miss that might take place in the next instruction and fetches the data before the actual memory reference. The goal of prefetching is to reduce as many cache misses as possible. In this paper we present a detailed summary of the different prefetching techniques, and implement a composite prefetcher prototype that employs the techniques of Sequential, Stride and Distance Prefetching.},

On one hand this leads to better energy efficiency if clock frequencies and core voltages are reduced. On the other hand this delivers very high performance to the software developer and thus enables complex software systems to be implemented. Unfortunately, debugging and validation of these systems becomes extremely difficult. Various technological approaches try to solve this dilemma. In this contribution we will show a new approach to observe multi-core SoCs and make their internal operations visible to external analysis tools. Also, we show that runtime verification can be employed to analyze and validate these internal operations while the system operates in its normal environment. The combination of these two approaches delivers unprecedented options to the developer to understand and verify system behavior even in complex multicore SoCs.},

  abstract = {CLOCK is a classical cache replacement policy dating back to 1968 that was proposed as a low-complexity approximation to LRU. On every cache hit, the policy LRU needs to move the accessed item to the most recently used position, at which point, to ensure consistency and correctness, it serializes cache hits behind a single global lock. CLOCK eliminates this lock contention, and, hence, can support high concurrency and high throughput environments such as virtual memory (for example, Multics, UNIX, BSD, AIX) and databases (for example, DB2). Unfortunately, CLOCK is still plagued by disadvantages of LRU such as disregard for "frequency", susceptibility to scans, and low performance.As our main contribution, we propose a simple and elegant new algorithm, namely, CLOCK with Adaptive Replacement (CAR), that has several advantages over CLOCK: (i) it is scan-resistant; (ii) it is self-tuning and it adaptively and dynamically captures the "recency" and "frequency" features of a workload; (iii) it uses essentially the same primitives as CLOCK, and, hence, is low-complexity and amenable to a high-concurrency implementation; and (iv) it outperforms CLOCK across a wide-range of cache sizes and workloads. The algorithm CAR is inspired by the Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC) algorithm, and inherits virtually all advantages of ARC including its high performance, but does not serialize cache hits behind a single global lock. As our second contribution, we introduce another novel algorithm, namely, CAR with Temporal filtering (CART), that has all the advantages of CAR, but, in addition, uses a certain temporal filter to distill pages with long-term utility from those with only short-term utility.},

The number of words of information in a program often exceeds the number of cells (i.e., word locations) in memory. The only way to solve this problem is to assign more than one program word to a cell. Since a cell can hold only one word at a time, extra words assigned to the cell must be held in external storage. Conventionally, overlay techniques are employed to exchange memory words and external-storage words whenever needed; this, of course, places an additional planning and coding burden on the programmer. For several reasons, it would be advantageous to rid the programmer of this function by providing him with a ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù memory larger than his program. An approach that permits him to use a sufficiently large address range can accomplish this objective, assuming that means are provided for automatic execution of the memory-overlay functions.},

However, they fail to deliver utmost performance since the history information exploited is incomplete. Motivated by the limitations of existing algorithms, this paper proposes a novel replacement scheme, called the Pattern-assisted Adaptive Recency Caching (PARC). PARC simultaneously utilizes the history information of recency, frequency, and access patterns to estimate the locality strength and to select the victim block. Specifically, PARC exploits the reference regularities exhibited in past behaviors, including looping or sequential references, to actively and rapidly adapt the recency and frequency information of blocks so as to exactly distill blocks with long-term utility from those with only short-term utility. Through comprehensive simulations on a variety of traces of different access patterns, we show that PARC is robust since, except for random workloads where the performance of each cache replacement algorithm is similar, PARC always outperforms the least recently used (LRU) scheme and other existing cache replacement algorithms.},

  abstract = {To boost input-output performance, operating systems employ a kernel-managed caching space called the buffer cache or page cache. Given the limited size of a buffer cache, an effective cache manager is required to decide which blocks should be evicted from the cache. Previous cache managers use historical information to make replacement decisions. However, existing approaches are unable to maximize performance since they rely on limited historical information. Motivated by the limitations of existing solutions, this paper proposes a novel manager called the Pattern-assisted Adaptive Recency Caching (PARC) manager. PARC simultaneously uses the historical information of recency, frequency, and access patterns to estimate the locality strengths of blocks and, upon a cache miss, evicts the block with the least strength. Specifically, PARC exploits the reference regularities exhibited in past input-output behaviors to actively and rapidly adapt the recency and frequency information of blocks so as to precisely distinguish blocks with long- and short-term utility. Through comprehensive simulations on a variety of traces of different access patterns, we show that PARC is robust since, except for random workloads where the performance of each cache manager is similar, PARC always outperforms existing solutions.},

  abstract = {In recent years, 3D technology has been a popular area of study that has allowed researchers to explore a number of novel computer architectures. One of the more popular topics is that of integrating 3D main memory dies below the computing die and connecting them with through-silicon vias (TSVs). This is assumed to reduce off-chip main memory access latencies by roughly 45\% to 60\%. Our detailed circuit-level models, however, demonstrate that this latency reduction from the TSVs is significantly less. In this paper, we present these models, compare 2D and 3D main memory latencies, and show that the reduction in latency from using 3D main memory to be no more than 2.4 ns. We also show that although the wider I/O bus width enabled by using TSVs increases performance, it may do so with an increase in power consumption. Although TSVs consume less power per bit transfer than off-chip metal interconnects (11.2 times less power per bit transfer), TSVs typically use considerably more bits and may result in a net increase in power due to the large number of bits in the memory I/O bus. Our analysis shows that although a 3D memory hierarchy exploiting a wider memory bus can increase performance, this performance increase may not justify the net increase in power consumption.},

This leads to high variance in the latency of different requests issued by the threads of a warp. Since a warp in a SIMT architecture can proceed only when all of its memory requests are returned by memory, such latency divergence causes significant slowdown when running irregular GPGPU applications. To solve this issue, we propose memory scheduling mechanisms that avoid inter-warp interference in the DRAM system to reduce the average memory stall latency experienced by warps. We further reduce latency divergence through mechanisms that coordinate scheduling decisions across multiple independent memory channels. Finally we show that carefully orchestrating the memory scheduling policy can achieve low average latency for warps, without compromising bandwidth utilization. Our combined scheme yields a 10.1\% performance improvement for irregular GPGPU workloads relative to a throughput-optimized GPU memory controller.},

First, replacement policies have been designed to evict dead blocks early and retain the potentially live blocks. Second, dynamic insertion policies attempt to victimize single-use blocks (dead on fill) as early as possible, thereby leaving most of the working set undisturbed in the cache. However, we observe that as the last-level cache grows in capacity and associativity, the traditional dead block prediction-based replacement policy loses effectiveness because often the LRU block itself is dead leading to an LRU replacement decision. The benefit of dynamic insertion policies is also small in a large class of applications that exhibit a significant number of cache blocks with small, yet more than one, uses.},

  abstract = {Current DRAM based memory systems face the scalability challenges in terms of storage density, power, and cost. Hybrid memory architecture composed of emerging Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) and DRAM is a promising approach to large-capacity and energy-efficient main memory. However, hybrid memory systems pose a new challenge to on-chip cache management due to the asymmetrical penalty of memory access to DRAM and NVM in case of cache misses. Cache hit rate is no longer an effective metric for evaluating memory access performance in hybrid memory systems. Current cache replacement policies that aim to improve cache hit rate are not efficient either. In this paper, we take into account the asymmetry of cache miss penalty on DRAM and NVM, and advocate a more general metric, Average Memory Access Time (AMAT), to evaluate the performance of hybrid memories. We propose a miss penalty-aware LRU-based (MALRU) cache replacement policy for hybrid memory systems. MALRU is aware of the source (DRAM or NVM) of missing blocks and prevents high-latency NVM blocks as well as low-latency DRAM blocks with good temporal locality from being evicted. Experimental results show that MALRU improves system performance against LRU and the state-of-the-art HAP policy by up to 20.4\% and 11.7\% (11.1\% and 5.7\% on average), respectively.},

Unfortunately, most of the policies are static. Nimrod Megiddo etc put forward a low overhead adaptive policy called ARC. It outperforms most of the static policies in most situations. But, ARC adapts itself to the workloads by the feedback of the missed pages. It hasn 't carried out the adaption before missed pages are discovered. We propose a high performance adaptive replacement policy. It adapts itself to the workloads by the feedback of the hit pages, so, it is more sensitive to the changes of the workloads than ARC. As the policy stares at the tails of the queues regardless of other pages, we name the policy as short-sighted adaptive replacement policy. The ARC usually regrets for the missed pages and wishes to rescue the neighborhood of them. However, SSARC endeavors to protect the would-be-reused pages from being replaced aggressively. So, it outperforms ARC in most situations. We compared SSARC with LRU, 2Q and ARC. The trace-driven experiments represent that SSARC gains higher performance.},

An economical solution to this desire is the implementation of a Memory Hierarchical System, which takes advantage of locality and cost/performance of memory technologies. As time has gone by, the technology has progressed, bringing about various changes in the way memory systems are built. Memory systems must be flexible enough to accommodate various levels of memory hierarchies, and must be able to emulate an environment with unlimited amount of memory. For more than two decades the main emphasis of memory system designers has been achieving high performance. However, recent market trends and application requirements suggest that other design goals such as low-power, predictability, and flexibility/reconfigurability are becoming equally important to consider. This paper gives a comprehensive overview of memory systems with the objective to give any reader a broad overview. Emphasis is put on the various components of a typical memory system of present-day systems and emerging new memory system architecture trends.

The proposed scheme is based on the low inter-reference recency set (LIRS) scheme, which is currently known to be very effective. However, the proposed scheme employs several history information items whereas the LIRS scheme uses only one history information item. The overhead of the proposed scheme is almost negligible. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, the comprehensive trace-driven computer simulation is used in general access patterns. Our simulation results show that the cache hit ratio (CHR) in the proposed scheme is improved as much as 65.3\% (with an average of 26.6\%) compared to the LRU for the same workloads, and up to 6\% compared to the LIRS in multi3 trace.},

Emerging memory technologies can enable faster access to significantly larger volumes of data than what is possible today. However, these memory technologies have a significant caveat: their random access latency falls in a range that cannot be effectively hidden using current hardware and software latency-hiding techniques-namely, the microsecond range. Finding the root cause of this "Killer Microsecond" problem, is the subject of this work. Our goal is to answer the critical question of why existing hardware and software cannot hide microsecond-level latencies, and whether drastic changes to existing platforms are necessary to utilize microsecond-latency devices effectively. We use an FPGA-based microsecond-latency device emulator, a carefully-crafted microbenchmark, and three open-source data-intensive applications to show that existing systems are indeed incapable of effectively hiding such latencies. However, after uncovering the root causes of the problem, we show that simple changes to existing systems are sufficient to support microsecond-latency devices. In particular, we show that by replacing on-demand memory accesses with prefetch requests followed by fast user-mode context switches (to increase access-level parallelism) and enlarging hardware queues that track in-flight accesses (to accommodate many parallel accesses), conventional architectures can effectively hide microsecond-level latencies, and approach the performance of DRAM-based implementations of the same applications. In other words, we show that successful usage of microsecond-level devices is not predicated on drastically new hardware and software architectures.},

Despite existing contributions to WCET analysis for these complex architectures, there are open problems. The single-path code generation overcomes these problems by generating time-predictable code that has a single execution trace. However, the simplicity of this approach comes at the cost of longer execution times. This paper addresses performance improvements for single-path code. We propose a time-predictable memory hierarchy with a prefetcher that exploits the predictability of execution traces in single-path code to speed up code execution. The new memory hierarchy reduces both the cache-miss penalty time and the cache-miss rate on the instruction cache.

  abstract = {Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC) and CLOCK with Adaptive Replacement (CAR) are state-of-the- art "adaptive" cache replacement algorithms invented to improve on the shortcomings of classical cache replacement policies such as LRU, LFU and CLOCK. By separating out items that have been accessed only once and items that have been accessed more frequently, both ARC and CAR are able to control the harmful effect of single-access items flooding the cache and pushing out more frequently accessed items. Both ARC and CAR have been shown to outperform their classical and popular counterparts in practice. Both algorithms are complex, yet popular. Even though they can be treated as online algorithms with an "adaptive" twist, a theoretical proof of the competitiveness of ARC and CAR remained unsolved for over a decade. We show that the competitiveness ratio of CAR (and ARC) has a lower bound of N + 1 (where N is the size of the cache) and an upper bound of 18N (4N for ARC). If the size of cache offered to ARC or CAR is larger than the one provided to OPT, then we show improved competitiveness ratios. The important implication of the above results are that no "pathological" worst-case request sequences exist that could deteriorate the performance of ARC and CAR by more than a constant factor as compared to LRU.},

The two methods were combined in this work in terms of their exploitation of locality. The comparative studies of the methods were done using real traces, and hit rate was used as an evaluation measure.Results showed that by using adaptive prefetching, the hit rate improved significantly by an average of 11.7\% over the hit rate of LRU in the traces and cache configurations used. It also showed that LRFU consistently gives higher hit rates than LRU, but not by much in the trace files and cache configurations tested. And the X value (a controllable parameter which determines the Weights given to recency and frequency) has to be in a certain range, which is usually narrow, in order to get the best performance for hit rate. Compared to adaptive prefetching and LRU, the hybrid approach of combining adaptive prefetching and LRFU gave a consistently higher hit rate also. But, affected by the performance of LRFU, the improvement in the hit rate by the combination was low.},

  abstract = {The increasing speed gap between processors and memories underlines the criticalness of cache memories. The strong area and power consumption constraints of general purpose embedded systems limit the size of cache memories. With the development of embedded systems provided with an operative system, these constraints are even stronger. The selection of an efficient replacement policy thus appears as critical. The Least Recently Used (LRU) strategy performs well on most memory patterns but this performance is obtained at the expense of the hardware requirements and of the power consumption. Consequently, new algorithms have been developed and this work is devoted to the evaluation of their performance. The implementation of a cache simulator allowed us to carry out a detailed investigation of the behaviour of the policies, which among others demonstrated the occurrence of Belady‚Äôs anomaly for a pseudo-LRU replacement algorithm, PLRUm. The replacement strategies that emerged from this study were then integrated in the ARM11 MPCore processor and their performance results were compared with the cache simulator ones. Our results show that the MRU-based pseudo-LRU replacement policy (PLRUm) approximates the LRU algorithm very closely and can even outperform it with low hardware and power consumption},

  abstract = {Performance of chip multiprocessors (CMPs) heavily depends on the efficiency of the caches. There is still a large gap between implemented replacement policies and the theoretical optimal policy. Among other factors, replacement policies play a major role in deciding the memory access time as they directly affect the miss-rate. In a CMP environment, the cost incurred by a miss in the higher level cache needs to take into account the communication latency over the on-chip network as well as power consumption.There are existing replacement policies which use this misscost rather than miss-count as an optimisation factor. These existing policies targeting the optimisation of miss-cost are mainly designed for the Last-Level Caches (LLC). Due to their significant hardware overheads, these policies are not directly applicable for the L1 caches. In this paper, we propose a new replacement policy, LA-LRU, for L1 caches which uses communication latency as a factor in deciding the victim. Experimental evaluation on full system simulation shows 7.4\% improvement in Average Memory Access Time (AMAT) which leads to 7\% improvement in Cycles Per Instruction (CPI). Reduction in on-chip communication also helps in improving the on-chip network power consumption by 14.8\%.},

  abstract = {Cache replacement policies play important roles in efficiently processing the current big data applications. The performance of any high performance computing system is highly depending on the performance of its cache memory. A better replacement policy allows the important blocks to be placed nearer to the core. Hence reduces the overall execution latency and gives better computational efficiency. There are different replacement policies exits. The main difference among these policies is how to select the victim block from the cache such that it can be replaced with another newly fetched block. Non-optimal replacement policy may remove important blocks from the cache when some less important (dead) blocks also present in the cache. Proposing better replacement policy for cache memory is a major research area from last three decades. The most widely used replacement policies used for classical cache memories are Least Recently Used Policy (LRU), Random Replacement Policy or Pseudo-LRU. As the technology advances the technology of cache memory is also changing. For efficient processing of big data based applications today‚Äôs computer having high performance computing ability requires larger cache memory. Such larger cache memory makes the task of replacement policies more challenging. In this paper we have done a survey about the innovations done in cache replacement policies to support the efficient processing of big data based applications.},

In the past, the common way to deal with this data was storing it for later offline analysis, which severely limits the time span that can be observed. In this contribution, we present an FPGA-based solution that is able to process the trace data in real-time, enabling continuous observation of the state of a core.

The collected information can be used for power, performance, and thermal management of the system as well as detecting anomalies or malicious behavior in the software. However, monitoring new or complex events using HPCs and existing tools is a challenging task because HPCs only provide a fixed pool of raw events to monitor. To address this challenge, we propose the implementation of a programmable hardware monitor in a complete system framework including the hardware monitor architecture and its interface with an in-order single-issue RISC-V processor as well as an operating system. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate how to programmatically implement a shadow stack using our hardware monitor and how the programmed shadow stack detects stack buffer overflow attacks. Our hardware monitor design incurs a 26 percent power overhead and a 15 percent area overhead over an unmodified RISC-V processor. Our programmed shadow stack has less than 3 percent performance overhead in the worst case.},

  abstract = {Large dense structures like DRAMs are particularly susceptible to process variation, which can lead to variable latencies in different memory arrays. However, very little work exists on variation studies in the DRAM. This is due to the fact that DRAMs were traditionally placed off-chip and their latency changes due to process variation did not impact the overall processor performance. However, emerging technology trends like three dimensional integration, use of sophisticated memory controllers and continued scaling of technology nodes, substantially reduces DRAM access latency. Hence future technology nodes will see widespread adoption of embedded DRAMs. This makes process variation a critical upcoming challenge in DRAMs that must be addressed in current and forthcoming technology generations. In this paper, we present techniques for modeling the effect of random as well as spatial variation in large DRAM array structures. We use sensitivity based gate level process variation models combined with statistical timing analysis to estimate the impact of process variation on the DRAM performance and leakage power. We also propose a simulated annealing based Vth assignment algorithm using adaptive body biasing to improve the yield of DRAM structures. Applying our algorithm on a 1GB DRAM array, we report an average of 10.3\% improvement in the DRAM yield. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first technique to model the impact of process variation on large scale DRAM arrays.},

  abstract = {Silicon debug is a major challenge due to continuously increasing design complexity. Traditional debug methods using signal tracing suffer from the limited capacity of on-chip trace buffers that only allow for signal observation during a short time window. We propose a low-cost debug architecture for massive signal tracing in ICs that integrate fast DRAM, such as 2D-ICs with embedded DRAM or 3D-stacked ICs with wide-I/O DRAM dies. The key idea is to use available on-chip DRAM for trace-data storage, which results in a significant increase of the observation window compared to traditional methods that use trace buffers. During a debug session, the entire observation window is divided into intervals and a signature is calculated for each observed interval using a multiple-input signature register. At run time, intervals containing erroneous bits are identified by comparing their signature with pre-calculated ‚Äúgolden‚Äù signatures that are stored in the DRAM a priori. Only failing intervals including their time stamp are stored into DRAM, which allows for a more efficient use of the memory, resulting in a larger observation window. The proposed method does not require multiple iterations or intermediate processing steps, hence it can be used during functional testing with minimum time overhead associated with the upload of golden signatures and the download of stored debug data to external equipment. We have created a Verilog RTL model for the proposed architecture, synthesized it using a 45 nm CMOS library, and verified its functionality by simulation. The results show that the observation window can be increased by orders of magnitude compared to prior work at comparable hardware cost.},

Often such systems must obey real-time constraints, calling for worst-case execution time assessment mechanisms. Although there is a wide range of simulation tools in the embedded systems domain, mechanisms for performing high abstraction level estimates for task execution times within a controlled environment are still needed. Non-determinism introduced by cache, multi-core and operating systems, for example, makes timing analysis highly complex or even impossible. We address this problem by presenting a RISC-V Instruction Set Simulation platform equipped with a task profiling mechanism for cache aware execution time measurements. The generated SystemC processor simulation model is integrated within a high abstraction level simulation platform with main memory and cache. Experimental results show that by making use of this kind of platform, designers can easily monitor task execution time as a function of measured code portion, cache sizes or cache policies employed helping in their decisions.},

In static cache locking, the locked memory blocks remain unchanged throughout the program execution. Thus static locking may not be effective for large programs where multiple memory blocks are competing for few cache lines available for locking. In comparison, dynamic cache locking overcomes cache space limitation through time-multiplexing of locked memory blocks. Prior dynamic locking technique partitions the program into regions and takes independent locking decisions for each region. We propose a flexible loop-based dynamic cache locking approach. We not only select the memory blocks to be locked but also the locking points (e.g., loop level). We judiciously allow memory blocks from the same loop to be locked at different program points for WCET improvement. We design a constraint-based approach that incorporates a global view to decide on the number of locking slots at each loop entry point and then select the memory blocks to be locked for each loop. Experimental evaluation shows that our dynamic cache locking approach achieves substantial improvement of WCET compared to prior techniques.},

At the same time, caches introduce imprecision in Worst-case Execution Time (WCET) estimation due to unpredictable access latencies. Modern embedded processors often include cache locking mechanism for better timing predictability. As the cache contents are statically known, memory access latencies are predictable, leading to precise WCET estimate. Moreover, by carefully selecting the memory blocks to be locked, WCET estimate can be reduced compared to cache modeling without locking. Existing static instruction cache locking techniques strive to lock the entire cache to minimize the WCET. We observe that such aggressive locking mechanisms may have negative impact on the overall WCET as some memory blocks with predictable access behavior get excluded from the cache. We introduce a partial cache locking mechanism that has the flexibility to lock only a fraction of the cache. We judiciously select the memory blocks for locking through accurate cache modeling that determines the impact of the decision on the program WCET. Our synergistic cache modeling and locking mechanism achieves substantial reduction in WCET for a large number of embedded benchmark applications.},

In contrast to the recency based approaches used in the past (LRU for example), our algorithm also uses the notion of frequency of access. Instead of evicting the least recently used block, our algorithm identifies among a set of LRU blocks the one that is also least-frequently-used (according to a heuristic) and chooses that as a victim. We have implemented this replacement algorithm in a detailed simulation model of a chip multiprocessor system driven by SPEC2000 benchmarks. We have found that the new scheme improves performance for memory intensive applications. Moreover, as compared to other attempts, our replacement algorithm provides robust improvements across all benchmarks. We have also extended an earlier scheme proposed by Wong and Baer so it is switched off when performance is not improved. Our results show that this makes the scheme much more suitable for CMP configurations.},

This investigation focuses on the dependence of the number of bit-scanning operations on the value of ¬µ and on properties of the string of page references. The number of such operations is a measure of the system overhead incurred while making replacement decisions. In particular, for several algorithms, the number of scans per reference is shown to be approximately proportional to ¬µ However, empirical results from single-program traces show that the value of ¬µ has little effect on the miss ratio. Although the miss ratios for the bit-scanning algorithms are close to those of least recently used (LRU), it is pointed out that increasing the value of ¬µ need not bring the bit-scanning policies closer to LRU management.},

This unpredictability is highly undesired for real-time systems. The Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) of a software running on an embedded processor is one of the most important metrics during real-time system design. The WCET depends to a large extent on the total amount of time spent for memory accesses. In the presence of caches, WCET analysis must always assume a memory access to be a cache miss if it can not be guaranteed that it is a hit. Hence, WCETs for cached systems are imprecise due to the overestimation caused by the caches.},

Do such traditional caching policies still work effectively when applied to systems with petabytes of data? In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate the performance of several cache policies, which include First-In-First-Out (FIFO), Least Recently Used (LRU) and Least Frequently Used (LFU), on the global satellite imagery distribution application maintained by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science Center (EROS). Evidence is presented suggesting traditional caching policies are capable of providing performance gains when applied to large data sets as with smaller data sets.

  abstract = {Fast access requirements preclude building L1 instruction caches large enough to capture the working set of server workloads. Efforts exist to mitigate limited L1 instruction cache capacity by relying on the stability and repetitiveness of the instruction stream to predict and prefetch future instruction blocks prior to their use. However, dynamic variation in cache miss sequences prevents correct and timely prediction, leaving many instruction-fetch stalls exposed, resulting in a key performance bottleneck for servers. We observe that, while the vast majority of application instruction references are amenable to prediction, even minor control-flow variations are amplified by microarchitectural components, resulting in a major source of instability and randomness that significantly limit prefetcher utility. Control-flow variation disturbs the L1 instruction cache replacement order and branch predictor state, causing the L1 instruction cache to randomly filter the instruction stream while the branch predictor and spontaneous hardware interrupts inject the stream with unpredictable noise. Based on this observation, we show that an instruction prefetcher, previously plagued by microarchitectural instability, becomes nearly perfect when modified to operate on the correct-path, retire-order instruction stream. We propose Proactive Instruction Fetch, an instruction prefetch mechanism that achieves higher than 99.5\% instruction-cache hit rate, improving server throughput by 27\% and nearly matching the performance of a perfect L1 instruction cache that never misses.},

Two major bottlenecks in the performance of multimedia and network applications are long memory latencies and limited off-chip processor bandwidth. Aggressive prefetching can be used to mitigate the memory latency problem, but overly aggressive prefetching may overload the limited external processor bandwidth. To accommodate both problems, we propose multilevel memory prefetching. The multi-level organization enables conservative prefetching on-chip and more aggressive prefetching off-chip. The combination provides aggressive prefetching while minimally impacting off-chip bandwidth, enabling more efficient memory performance for media and stream processing. This paper presents preliminary results for multi-level memory prefetching, which show that combining prefetching at the L1 and DRAM memory levels provides the most effective prefetching with minimal extra bandwidth.},

  abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards using multi-core processors
in real-time systems to cope with the rising computation requirements of
real-time tasks. Coupled with this, the rising memory requirements of these tasks
pushes demand beyond what can be provided by small, private on-chip caches, requiring
the use of larger, slower off-chip memories such as DRAM. Due to the cost,
power requirements and complexity of these memories, they are typically shared
between all of the tasks within the system.
In order for the execution time of these tasks to be bounded, the response time
of the memory and the interference from other tasks also needs to be bounded.
While there is a great amount of current research on bounding this interference,
one popular method is to effectively partition the available memory bandwidth
between the processors in the system. Of course, as the number of processors
increases, so does the worst-case blocking, and worst-case blocking times quickly
increase with the number of processors.
It is difficult to further optimise the arbitration scheme; instead, this scaling problem
needs to be approached from another angle. Prefetching has previously been
shown to improve the execution time of tasks by speculatively issuing memory
accesses ahead of time for items which may be useful in the near future, although
these prefetchers are typically not used in real-time systems due to their unpredictable
nature. Instead, this work presents a framework by which a prefetcher
can be safely used alongside a composable memory arbiter, a predictable prefetching
scheme, and finally a method by which this predictable prefetcher can be used
to improve the worst-case execution time of a running task.},

  abstract = {Endpoint devices for Internet-of-Things not only need to work under extremely tight power envelope of a few milliwatts, but also need to be flexible in their computing capabilities, from a few kOPS to GOPS. Near-threshold (NT) operation can achieve higher energy efficiency, and the performance scalability can be gained through parallelism. In this paper, we describe the design of an open-source RISC-V processor core specifically designed for NT operation in tightly coupled multicore clusters. We introduce instruction extensions and microarchitectural optimizations to increase the computational density and to minimize the pressure toward the shared-memory hierarchy. For typical data-intensive sensor processing workloads, the proposed core is, on average, 3.5√ó faster and 3.2√ó more energy efficient, thanks to a smart L0 buffer to reduce cache access contentions and support for compressed instructions. Single Instruction Multiple Data extensions, such as dot products, and a built-in L0 storage further reduce the shared-memory accesses by 8√ó reducing contentions by 3.2√ó. With four NT-optimized cores, the cluster is operational from 0.6 to 1.2 V, achieving a peak efficiency of 67 MOPS/mW in a low-cost 65-nm bulk CMOS technology. In a low-power 28-nm FD-SOI process, a peak efficiency of 193 MOPS/mW (40 MHz and 1 mW) can be achieved.},

Most of primary caches employ a simple block replacement algorithm like pseudo LRU to avoid the disadvantages of a complex hardware design. In this paper, we propose a novel block replacement scheme, MPLRU (modified pseudo LRU), by exploiting second chance concept in pseudo LRU algorithm. A comprehensive comparison is made between our algorithm and both true LRU and other conventional schemes such as FIFO, random and pseudo LRU. Experimental results show that MPLRU significantly reduces the number of cache misses compared to the other algorithms. Simulation results reveal that in average our algorithm can provide a value of 8.52\% improvement on the miss ratio compared to the pseudo LRU algorithm. Moreover, it provides 7.93\% and 11.57\%performance improvement compared to FIFO and random replacement policies respectively},

However, most of the processors employ a block replacement algorithm which is very simple to implement in hardware or that is an approximation to the true LRU. In this paper, we propose a new implementation of block replacement algorithms in CPU caches by designing the circuitry required to implement an LRU replacement policy in set associative caches. We propose a simple and efficient architecture, Pseudo-FIFO, such that the true LRU replacement algorithm can be implemented without the disadvantages of the traditional implementations. Experimental results show that the Pseudo-FIFO significantly reduces the number of memory cells needed for hardware implementation.

However, the voltage scaling trend has failed to keep up, introducing tight power constraints on manufactured parts. In such a scenario, there is a need to incorporate energy-efficient processing resources that can enable more computation within the same power budget. Energy efficiency solutions in the past have typically relied on application specific hardware and accelerators. Unfortunately, these approaches do not extend to general purpose applications due to their irregular and diverse code base. Towards this end, we propose BERET, an energy-efficient co-processor that can be configured to benefit a wide range of applications. Our approach identifies recurring instruction sequences as phases of ‚Äútemporal regularity‚Äù in a program's execution, and maps suitable ones to the BERET hardware, a three-stage pipeline with a bundled execution model. This judicious off-loading of program execution to a reduced-complexity hardware demonstrates significant savings on instruction fetch, decode and register file accesses energy. On average, BERET reduces energy consumption by a factor of 3-4X for the program regions selected across a range of general-purpose and media applications. The average energy savings for the entire application run was 35\% over a single-issue in-order processor.},

Proxy server reduces the load of server. If the cache replacement algorithm of proxy server's cache is efficient then proxy server will be helpful to reduce the network traffic in more efficient manner. In this paper we are considering proxy server cache to be Level 1 (L1) cache and storage cache of proxy server to be Level 2 (L2) cache. For collecting the real trace CC proxy server is used in an organization. Log of proxy server gives the information of various URLs accessed by various clients with time. For performing experiments various URLs were given a numeric identity. This paper proposes an efficient replacement algorithm on L1 for proxy server. The replacement algorithms taken into consideration are Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Frequently Used (LFU), First In First Out (FIFO). Access Pattern of L1 and L2 are different as if the desired page is not on L1 then it accesses to L2. Thus L1 is having better temporal locality than L2. Thus the replacement algorithm which is giving efficient results for L1 may not be suitable for L2.

  abstract = {The goal of cache management is to maximize data reuse. Collaborative caching provides an interface for software to communicate access information to hardware. In theory, it can obtain optimal cache performance. In this paper, we study a collaborative caching system that allows a program to choose different caching methods for its data. As an interface, it may be used in arbitrary ways, sometimes optimal but probably suboptimal most times and even counter productive. We develop a theoretical foundation for collaborative caches to show the inclusion principle and the existence of a distance metric we call LRU-MRU stack distance. The new stack distance is important for program analysis and transformation to target a hierarchical collaborative cache system rather than a single cache configuration. We use 10 benchmark programs to show that optimal caching may reduce the average miss ratio by 24\%, and a simple feedback-driven compilation technique can utilize collaborative cache to realize 50\% of the optimal improvement.},

  abstract = {On-chip DRAM caches may alleviate the memory bandwidth problem in future multi-core architectures through reducing off-chip accesses via increased cache capacity. For memory intensive applications, recent research has demonstrated the benefits of introducing high capacity on-chip L4-DRAM as Last-Level-Cache between L3-SRAM and off-chip memory. These multi-core cache hierarchies attempt to exploit the latency benefits of L3-SRAM and capacity benefits of L4-DRAM caches. However, not taking into consideration the cache access patterns of complex applications can cause inter-core DRAM interference and inter-core cache contention. In this paper, we contest to re-architect existing cache hierarchies by proposing a hybrid cache architecture, where the Last-Level-Cache is a combination of SRAM and DRAM caches. We propose an adaptive DRAM placement policy in response to the diverse requirements of complex applications with different cache access behaviors. It reduces inter-core DRAM interference and inter-core cache contention in SRAM/DRAM-based hybrid cache architectures: increasing the harmonic mean instruction-per-cycle throughput by 23.3\% (max. 56\%) and 13.3\% (max. 35.1\%) compared to state-of-the-art.},

The widening latency gap between high speed cores and memory has led to the evolution of multi-level SRAM/DRAM cache hierarchies that exploit the latency benefits of smaller caches (e.g. private L1 and L2 SRAM caches) and the capacity benefits of larger caches (e.g. shared L3 SRAM and shared L4 DRAM cache). The main problem of employing large L3/L4 caches is their high tag lookup latency. To solve this problem, we introduce the novel concept of small and low latency SRAM/DRAM Tag-Cache structures that can quickly determine whether an access to the large L3/L4 caches will be a hit or a miss. The performance of the proposed Tag-Cache architecture depends upon the Tag-Cache hit rate and to improve it we propose a novel Tag-Cache insertion policy and a DRAM row buffer mapping policy that reduce the latency of memory requests. For a 16-core system, this improves the average harmonic mean instruction per cycle throughput of latency sensitive applications by 13.3\% compared to state-of-the-art.},

We identify that this additional latency has a substantial effect on performance for an important class of latency-critical memory operations: those that result in a cache miss and are dependent on data from a prior cache miss. We observe that the number of instructions between the first cache miss and its dependent cache miss is usually small. To minimize dependent cache miss latency, we propose adding just enough functionality to dynamically identify these instructions at the core and migrate them to the memory controller for execution as soon as source data arrives from DRAM. This migration allows memory requests issued by our new Enhanced Memory Controller (EMC) to experience a 20\% lower latency than if issued by the core. On a set of memory intensive quad-core workloads, the EMC results in a 13\% improvement in system performance and a 5\% reduction in energy consumption over a system with a Global History Buffer prefetcher, the highest performing prefetcher in our evaluation.},

In this work, we develop a low-cost mechanism, called ChargeCache, that enables faster access to recently-accessed rows in DRAM, with no modifications to DRAM chips. Our mechanism is based on the key observation that a recently-accessed row has more charge and thus the following access to the same row can be performed faster. To exploit this observation, we propose to track the addresses of recently-accessed rows in a table in the memory controller. If a later DRAM request hits in that table, the memory controller uses lower timing parameters, leading to reduced DRAM latency. Row addresses are removed from the table after a specified duration to ensure rows that have leaked too much charge are not accessed with lower latency. We evaluate ChargeCache on a wide variety of workloads and show that it provides significant performance and energy benefits for both single-core and multi-core systems.},

A plethora of existing works focus on the analysis of Double Data Rate Dynamic Random Access Memories (DDR DRAMs), or redesigning its memory to provide predictable memory behavior. In this paper, we show that DDR DRAMs by construction suffer inherent limitations associated with achieving such predictability. These limitations lead to 1) highly variable access latencies that fluctuate based on various factors such as access patterns and memory state from previous accesses, and 2) overly pessimistic latency bounds. As a result, DDR DRAMs can be ill-suited for some real-time systems that mandate a strict predictable performance with tight timing constraints. Targeting these systems, we promote an alternative off-chip memory solution that is based on the emerging Reduced Latency DRAM (RLDRAM) protocol, and propose a predictable memory controller (RLDC) managing accesses to this memory. Comparing with the state-of-the-art predictable DDR controllers, the proposed solution provides up to 11√ó less timing variability and 6.4√ó reduction in the worst case memory latency.},

The results give an overview of performance tradeoffs in the whole relevant range for web caching with Zipf request pattern. In a second part, we study a combined approach of the optimum strategy for a limited look-ahead with LRU, LFU or other non-predictive methods. We evaluate the hit rate gain depending on the extent of the look-ahead for request traces and for the independent reference model (IRM) via simulation and derive an analytic confirmation of the observed behaviour. It is shown that caching for video streaming can benefit from the proposed look-ahead technique, when replacement decisions can be partly revised due to new requests being encountered during long lasting content updates.},

  abstract = {3D-stacking technology has enabled the option of embedding a large DRAM onto the processor. Prior works have proposed to use this as a DRAM cache. Because of its large size (a DRAM cache can be in the order of hundreds of megabytes), the total size of the tags associated with it can also be quite large (in the order of tens of megabytes). The large size of the tags has created a problem. Should we maintain the tags in the DRAM and pay the cost of a costly tag access in the critical path? Or should we maintain the tags in the faster SRAM by paying the area cost of a large SRAM for this purpose? Prior works have primarily chosen the former and proposed a variety of techniques for reducing the cost of a DRAM tag access. In this paper, we first establish (with the help of a study) that maintaining the tags in SRAM, because of its smaller access latency, leads to overall better performance. Motivated by this study, we ask if it is possible to maintain tags in SRAM without incurring high area overhead. Our key idea is simple. We propose to cache the tags in a small SRAM tag cache - we show that there is enough spatial and temporal locality amongst tag accesses to merit this idea. We propose the ATCache which is a small SRAM tag cache. Similar to a conventional cache, the ATCache caches recently accessed tags to exploit temporal locality; it exploits spatial locality by prefetching tags from nearby cache sets. In order to avoid the high miss latency and cache pollution caused by excessive prefetching, we use a simple technique to throttle the number of sets prefetched. Our proposed ATCache (which consumes 0.4\% of overall tag size) can satisfy over 60\% of DRAM cache tag accesses on average.},

  abstract = {Recent research advocates large die-stacked DRAM caches in many core servers to break the memory latency and bandwidth wall. To realize their full potential, die-stacked DRAM caches necessitate low lookup latencies, high hit rates and the efficient use of off-chip bandwidth. Today's stacked DRAM cache designs fall into two categories based on the granularity at which they manage data: block-based and page-based. The state-of-the-art block-based design, called Alloy Cache, collocates a tag with each data block (e.g., 64B) in the stacked DRAM to provide fast access to data in a single DRAM access. However, such a design suffers from low hit rates due to poor temporal locality in the DRAM cache. In contrast, the state-of-the-art page-based design, called Footprint Cache, organizes the DRAM cache at page granularity (e.g., 4KB), but fetches only the blocks that will likely be touched within a page. In doing so, the Footprint Cache achieves high hit rates with moderate on-chip tag storage and reasonable lookup latency. However, multi-gigabyte stacked DRAM caches will soon be practical and needed by server applications, thereby mandating tens of MBs of tag storage even for page-based DRAM caches. We introduce a novel stacked-DRAM cache design, Unison Cache. Similar to Alloy Cache's approach, Unison Cache incorporates the tag metadata directly into the stacked DRAM to enable scalability to arbitrary stacked-DRAM capacities. Then, leveraging the insights from the Footprint Cache design, Unison Cache employs large, page-sized cache allocation units to achieve high hit rates and reduction in tag overheads, while predicting and fetching only the useful blocks within each page to minimize the off-chip traffic. Our evaluation using server workloads and caches of up to 8GB reveals that Unison cache improves performance by 14\% compared to Alloy Cache due to its high hit rate, while outperforming the state-of-the art page-based designs that require impractical SRAM-based tags of around 50MB.},

  abstract = {√êA new buffer replacement scheme, called DEAR (DEtection-based Adaptive Replacement), is presented for effective caching of disk blocks in the operating system. The proposed DEAR scheme automatically detects block reference patterns of applications and applies different replacement policies to different applications depending on the detected reference pattern. The detection is made by a periodic process and is based on the relationship between block attribute values, such as backward distance and frequency gathered in a period, and the forward distance observed in the next period. This paper also describes an implementation and performance measurement of the DEAR scheme in FreeBSD. The results from performance measurements of several real applications show that, compared with the LRU scheme, the proposed scheme reduces the number of disk I/Os by up to 51 percent (with an average of 23 percent) and the response time by up to 35 percent (with an average of 12 percent) in the case of single application executions. For multiple application executions, the results show that the proposed scheme reduces the number of disk I/Os by up to 20 percent (with an average of 12 percent) and the overall response time by up to 18 percent (with an average of 8 percent).},

  abstract = {Many multi-core processors employ a large last-level cache (LLC) shared among the multiple cores. Past research has demonstrated that traditional LRU and its approximation can lead to poor performance and unfairness when the multiple cores compete for the limited LLC capacity, and is susceptible to thrashing for memory-intensive workloads that have a working set greater than the available cache size. As the LLC grows in capacity, associativity, the performance gap between the LRU and the theoretical optimal replacement algorithms has widened. In this paper, we propose FLRU (Frequency based LRU) replacement algorithm, which is applied to multi-core shared L2 cache, and it takes the recent access information, partition and the frequency information into consideration. FLRU manages to filter the less reused blocks through dynamic insertion/promotion policy and victim selection strategy to ensure that some fraction of the working set is retained in the cache so that at least that fraction of the working set can contribute to cache hits and to avoid trashing, meanwhile we augment traditional cache partition with victim selection, insertion and promotion policies to manage shared L2 caches.},

The LRU replacement policy has remained the standard for caches for many years. However, the traditional LRU has ineffective performance in zero-reuse line intensive workloads, although it performs well in high temporal locality workloads. To address this problem, We propose a new replacement policy; DCR(Dynamic Counter based Replacement) policy. A temporal locality of workload dynamically changes across time and DCR policy is based on the detection of these changing. DCR policy improves cache miss rate over a traditional LRU policy, by as much as 2.7\% at maximum and 0.47\% at average.},

  abstract = {As the performance gap between CPU and main memory speed increases, memory subsystem design more critical. Caches are important part of modern memory hierarchies. Cache performance is important in computer system. As the cache size is limited it should be properly utilized. After the cache block is used by an application it should be moved from cache to main memory so that another block required by other application can use its space [2]. Now a day's multi-level cache are used everywhere to provide better cache performance. As the block which is moved from cache memory to main memory may be required in future, so it is kept in lower level cache in the cache hierarchy. Therefore the cost of accessing the block from main memory is minimized. Many approaches like LRU-K, LFU, LRFU, PROMOTE, DEMOTE are used to increase cache performance by promoting or demoting a memory block into the cache depending upon its latest history [1] [21]. Some are used for single level cache and some for hierarchical cache. The drawback of existing multi-level cache management techniques is that it uses hints of level L1 only. It does not provide sufficient information about the history of the cache block at all previous cache levels. Therefore, a hybrid cache management policy is proposed in this paper which takes its replacement decision based on the multiple level cache level. In this paper, a hybrid cache management policy is proposed which constitute the feature of two existing algorithms PEOMOTE and DEMTE that gives better hit ratio than other existing policies.},

  abstract = {Several cache management techniques have been proposed that indirectly try to base their decisions on cacheline reuse-distance, like Cache Decay which is a postdiction of reuse-distances: if a cacheline has not been accessed for some "decay interval" we know that its reuse-distance is at least as large as this decay interval. In this work, we propose to directly predict reuse-distances via instruction-based (PC) prediction and use this information for cache level optimizations. In this paper, we choose as our target for optimization the replacement policy of the L2 cache, because the gap between the LRU and the theoretical optimal replacement algorithm is comparatively large for L2 caches. This indicates that, in many situations, there is ample room for improvement. We evaluate our reusedistance based replacement policy using a subset of the most memory intensive SPEC2000 and our results show significant benefits across the board.},

The key to our algorithm is to identify and subsequently discard the dead lines in cache memories. This allows our algorithm to provide better cache performance as compared to the conventional LRU (least recently used), MRU (most recently used) and FIFO (first-in, first-out) replacement policies. Extensive trace-driven simulations were performed for 30 different cache configurations using different SPEC (Standard Performance Evaluation Corp.) programs. Simulation results have shown that KORA can provide a substantial improvement in the miss ratio over the conventional algorithms.

We propose a cache segmentation technique that dynamically adapts to cache access patterns by predicting the best number of not-yet-referenced and already-referenced blocks in the cache. This technique is independent from the LRU policy so it can work with less expensive replacement policies. It can automatically detect when to bypass blocks to the CPU with no extra overhead. In a 2MB LLC single-core processor with a memory intensive subset of SPEC CPU 2006 benchmarks, it outperforms LRU replacement on average by 5.2\% with not-recently-used (NRU) replacement and on average by 2.2\% with random replacement. The technique also complements existing shared cache partitioning techniques. Our evaluation with 10 multi-programmed workloads shows that this technique improves performance of an 8MB LLC four-core system on average by 12\%, with a random replacement policy requiring only half the space of the LRU policy.},

  abstract = {The design of an effective last-level cache (LLC) in general-and an effective cache replacement/partitioning algorithm in particular-is critical to the overall system performance. The processor's ability to hide the LLC miss penalty differs widely from one miss to another. The more instructions the processor manages to issue during the miss, the better it is capable of hiding the miss penalty and the lower the cost of that miss. This nonuniformity in the processor's ability to hide LLC miss latencies, and the resultant nonuniformity in the performance impact of LLC misses, opens up an opportunity for a new cost-sensitive cache replacement algorithm. This paper makes two key contributions. First, It proposes a framework for estimating the costs of cache blocks at run-time based on the processor's ability to (partially) hide their miss latencies. Second, It proposes a simple, low-hardware overhead, yet effective, cache replacement algorithm that is locality-aware and cost-sensitive (LACS). LACS is thoroughly evaluated using a detailed simulation environment. LACS speeds up 12 LLC-performance-constrained SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks by up to 51\% and 11\% on average. When evaluated using a dual/quad-core CMP with a shared LLC, LACS significantly outperforms LRU in terms of performance and fairness, achieving improvements up to 54\%.},

  abstract = {In traditional file system implementations, the Least Recently Used (LRU) block replacement scheme is widely used to manage the buffer cache due to its simplicity and adaptability. However, the LRU scheme exhibits performance degradations because it does not make use of reference regularities such as sequential and looping references. In this paper, we present a Unified Buffer Management (UBM) scheme that exploits these regularities and yet, is simple to deploy. The UBM scheme automatically detects sequential and looping references and stores the detected blocks in separate partitions of the buffer cache. These partitions are managed by appropriate replacement schemes based on their detected patterns. The allocation problem among the divided partitions is also tackled with the use of the notion of marginal gains. In both trace-driven simulation experiments and experimental studies using an actual implementation in the FreeBSD operating system, the performance gains obtained through the use of this scheme are substantial. The results show that the hit ratios improve by as much as 57.7\% (with an average of 29.2\%) and the elapsed times are reduced by as much as 67.2\% (with an average of 28.7\%) compared to the LRU scheme for the workloads we used.},

In this work, we rigorously characterize the effects of reducing DRAM access latency on 282 state-of-the-art LPDDR4 DRAM modules. As found in prior work on older DRAM generations (DDR3), we show that regions of LPDDR4 DRAM modules can be accessed with latencies that are significantly lower than manufacturer-specified values without causing failures. We present novel data that 1) further supports the viability of such latency reduction mechanisms and 2) exposes a variety of new cases in which access latencies can be effectively reduced. Using our observations, we propose a new low-cost mechanism, Solar-DRAM, that 1) identifies failure-prone regions of DRAM at reduced latency and 2) robustly reduces average DRAM access latency while maintaining data correctness, by issuing DRAM requests with reduced access latencies to non-failure-prone DRAM regions. We evaluate Solar-DRAM on a wide variety of multi-core workloads and show that for 4-core homogeneous workloads, Solar-DRAM provides an average (maximum) system performance improvement of 4.31\% (10.87\%) compared to using the default fixed DRAM access latency.},

The key to improved performance is an innovative rank-switching mechanism which hides the latency of write-read transitions in DRAM devices without requiring unpredictable request reordering. We further employ open row policy to take advantage of the data caching mechanism (row buffering) in each device. ROC provides complete timing isolation between hard and soft tasks and allows for compositional timing analysis over the number of cores and memory ranks in the system.

As operating systems gain in popularity, even in deeply embedded systems, these techniques face the challenge to support multitasking. In this paper, we propose a novel non-intrusive technique, which efficiently reconstructs the execution trace of non-preemptive multitasking system by observing power consumption characteristics. Our technique uses the control-flow graph (CFG) of the application program to identify the most likely block of code that the system is executing at any given point in time. For the purpose of the experimental evaluation, we first instrument the source code to obtain power consumption information for each basic block, which is used as the training data for our Dynamic Time Warping and k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) classifier. Once the system is trained, this technique is used to identify live code-block execution (LCBE). We show that the technique can reconstruct the execution flow of programs in a multi-tasking environment with high accuracy.},

But it has been reported that prefetching can bring adverse result on some reference pattern. This paper proposes a prefet-ching frame that can be adopted on existing prefetching techniques simply. The frame called IPRP (Improving Prefetching Effects by Exploiting Reference Patterns) and detects reference patterns online and control pre-fetching upon the characteristics of the detected pattern. In our experiment, we adopted IPRP on Linux read-ahead prefetching. IPRP could prevent adverse result clearly when Linux read-ahead prefetching increases total execution time about \$40\%\{\textbackslash{}sim\}70\%\$. When Linux read-ahead prefetching could bring some benefit, IPRP with read- ahead performed similar or slightly better benefit on execution time. With this result we could see our IPRP can complement and improve legacy prefetching techniques efficiently.},

  abstract = {The capacity and cost-per-bit of DRAM have historically scaled to satisfy the needs of increasingly large and complex computer systems. However, DRAM latency has remained almost constant, making memory latency the performance bottleneck in today's systems. We observe that the high access latency is not intrinsic to DRAM, but a trade-off made to decrease cost-per-bit. To mitigate the high area overhead of DRAM sensing structures, commodity DRAMs connect many DRAM cells to each sense-amplifier through a wire called a bitline. These bitlines have a high parasitic capacitance due to their long length, and this bitline capacitance is the dominant source of DRAM latency. Specialized low-latency DRAMs use shorter bitlines with fewer cells, but have a higher cost-per-bit due to greater sense-amplifier area overhead. In this work, we introduce Tiered-Latency DRAM (TL-DRAM), which achieves both low latency and low cost-per-bit. In TL-DRAM, each long bitline is split into two shorter segments by an isolation transistor, allowing one segment to be accessed with the latency of a short-bitline DRAM without incurring high cost-per-bit. We propose mechanisms that use the low-latency segment as a hardware-managed or software-managed cache. Evaluations show that our proposed mechanisms improve both performance and energy-efficiency for both single-core and multi-programmed workloads.},

  abstract = {This paper presents novel cache optimizations for massively parallel, throughput-oriented architectures like GPUs. L1 data caches (L1 D-caches) are critical resources for providing high-bandwidth and low-latency data accesses. However, the high number of simultaneous requests from single-instruction multiple-thread (SIMT) cores makes the limited capacity of L1 D-caches a performance and energy bottleneck, especially for memory-intensive applications. We observe that the memory access streams to L1 D-caches for many applications contain a significant amount of requests with low reuse, which greatly reduce the cache efficacy. Existing GPU cache management schemes are either based on conditional/reactive solutions or hit-rate based designs specifically developed for CPU last level caches, which can limit overall performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose an efficient locality monitoring mechanism to dynamically filter the access stream on cache insertion such that only the data with high reuse and short reuse distances are stored in the L1 D-cache. Specifically, we present a design that integrates locality filtering based on reuse characteristics of GPU workloads into the decoupled tag store of the existing L1 D-cache through simple and cost-effective hardware extensions. Results show that our proposed design can dramatically reduce cache contention and achieve up to 56.8\% and an average of 30.3\% performance improvement over the baseline architecture, for a range of highly-optimized cache-unfriendly applications with minor area overhead and better energy efficiency. Our design also significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art CPU and GPU bypassing schemes (especially for irregular applications), without generating extra L2 and DRAM level contention.},

FB-DIMM has a unique two-level interconnect structure, with FB-DIMM channels at the first-level connecting the memory controller and advanced memory buffers (AMBs); and DDR2 buses at the second-level connecting the AMBs with DRAM chips. We propose an AMB prefetching method that prefetches memory blocks from DRAM chips to AMBs. It utilizes the redundant bandwidth between the DRAM chips and AMBs but does not consume the crucial channel bandwidth. The proposed method fetches K memory blocks of L2 cache block sizes around the demanded block, where K is a small value ranging from two to eight. The method may also reduce the DRAM power consumption by merging some DRAM precharges and activations. Our cycle-accurate simulation shows that the average performance improvement is 16\% for single-core and multi-core workloads constructed from memory-intensive SPEC2000 programs with software cache prefetching enabled; and no workload has negative speedup. We have found that the performance gain comes from the reduction of idle memory latency and the improvement of channel bandwidth utilization. We have also found that there is only a small overlap between the performance gains from the AMB prefetching and the software cache prefetching. The average of estimated power saving is 15\%},

The resulting gap between logic and memory performance has forced microprocessor designs toward complex and power-hungry architectures that support out-of-order and speculative execution. Moreover, processors have been designed with increasingly large cache hierarchies to hide main memory latency. This article examines how 3D IC technology can improve interactions between the processor and memory. Our work examines the performance of a single-core, single-threaded processor under representative work loads. We have shown that reducing memory latency by bringing main memory on chip gives us near-perfect performance. Three-dimensional IC technology can provide the much needed bandwidth without the cost, design complexity, and power issues associated with a large number of off-chip pins. The principal challenge remains the demonstration of a highly manufacturable 3D IC technology with high yield and low cost.},

  abstract = {Data caches in general-purpose microprocessors often contain mostly dead blocks and are thus used inefficiently. To improve cache efficiency, dead blocks should be identified and evicted early. Prior schemes predict the death of a block immediately after it is accessed; however, these schemes yield lower prediction accuracy and coverage. Instead, we find that predicting the death of a block when it just moves out of the MRU position gives the best tradeoff between timeliness and prediction accuracy/coverage. Furthermore, the individual reference history of a block in the L1 cache can be irregular because of data/control dependence. This paper proposes a new class of dead-block predictors that predict dead blocks based on bursts of accesses to a cache block. A cache burst begins when a block becomes MRU and ends when it becomes non-MRU. Cache bursts are more predictable than individual references because they hide the irregularity of individual references. When used at the L1 cache, the best burst-based predictor can identify 96\% of the dead blocks with a 96\% accuracy. With the improved dead-block predictors, we evaluate three ways to increase cache efficiency by eliminating dead blocks early: replacement optimization, bypassing, and prefetching. The most effective approach, prefetching into dead blocks, increases the average L1 efficiency from 8\% to 17\% and the L2 efficiency from 17\% to 27\%. This increased cache efficiency translates into higher overall performance: prefetching into dead blocks outperforms the same prefetch scheme without dead-block prediction by 12\% at the L1 and by 13\% at the L2.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a new memory scheduling policy called LAMS, which is inspired by a recently proposed memory architecture and targets for future high capacity memory systems. As memory capacity increases, the bit-lines connected to memory row buffers become much longer, dramatically lengthening memory access latency, due to increased parasitic capacitance. Recent study has proposed to partition long bit-lines into near and far (relative to the row buffer) segments via inserting isolation transistors such that access to near segment can be accomplished much faster, while access to far segment remains nearly the same. However, how to effectively leverage the new memory architecture still remains unexplored. We suggest to take advantage of this new memory architecture via performing latency-aware memory scheduling for pending requests to explore their performance potentials. In this scheduling policy, each memory request is classified to one of the following three categories, row-buffer hit, near-buffer, and far-buffer. Based on the classification, it issues requests in the order of row-buffer hit ‚Üí near-buffer ‚Üí far-buffer. In doing so, it avoids long-latency requests blocking short-latency memory requests, reducing total memory queuing time in the memory controller and improving overall memory performance. Our evaluation results on a simulated memory system show that comparing with the commonly used FR-FCFS scheduler, our LAMS improves performance and energy efficiency by up to 20.6\% and 34\%, respectively. Even comparing with the four competitive schedulers chosen from memory scheduling champion (MSC), LAMS still improves performance and energy efficiency by up to 6.1\% and 23.4\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {The evolution of DRAM technology has been driven by capacity and bandwidth during the last decade. In contrast, DRAM access latency stays relatively constant and is trending to increase. Much efforts have been devoted to tolerate memory access latency but these techniques have reached the point of diminishing returns. Having shorter bitline and wordline length in a DRAM device will reduce the access latency. However by doing so it will impact the array efficiency. In the mainstream market, manufacturers are not willing to trade capacity for latency. Prior works had proposed hybrid-bitline DRAM design to overcome this problem. However, those methods are either intrusive to the circuit and layout of the DRAM design, or there is no direct way to migrate data between the fast and slow levels. In this paper, we proposed a novel asymmetric DRAM with capability to perform low cost data migration between subarrays. Having this design we determined a simple management mechanism and explored many management related policies. We showed that with this new design and our simple management technique we could achieve 7.25\% and 11.77\% performance improvement in single- and multi-programming workloads, respectively, over a system with traditional homogeneous DRAM. This gain is above 80\% of the potential performance gain of a system based on a hypothetical DRAM which is made out of short bitlines entirely.},

How to reduce Memory Access Latency is a critical issue we have to deal with. Memory controller is difficult to optimize, the controller needs to obey all DRAM timing constraints to provide correct functionality. State-of -the-art DDR2 SDRAM chips often have a large number of timing constraints that must be obeyed when scheduling commands, for instance, over 50 timing constrains. We have made deep research on optimized memory access scheduling. In order to efficiently utilize the bandwidth and reduce the latency, Memory Access Scheduling optimization adapts the characters of DRAM to reschedule the memory access. By studying effective data bar which is generated by Genetic Algorithm, we mine four rules. So we just use these four rules to schedule in Memory Access Controller. The results of experiment show that compared with FR-FCFS (first-ready first-come first-serve) scheduling strategy, the rule based algorithm improves the performance of scheduling and the ideal speedup is near 1.5 times. The best speedup of the test of spec2000 is 1.467, and the worst speedup is 1.078.},

In this paper, we observe and make use of the DelinquentPC - Next-Use characteristic to improve shared cache performance. We propose a new PC-centric cache organization, NUcache, for the shared last level cache of multi-cores. NUcache logically partitions the associative ways of a cache set into MainWays and DeliWays. While all lines have access to the MainWays, only lines brought in by a subset of delinquent PCs, selected by a PC selection mechanism, are allowed to enter the DeliWays. The PC selection mechanism is an intelligent cost-benefit analysis based algorithm that utilizes Next-Use information to select the set of PCs that can maximize the hits experienced in DeliWays. Performance evaluation reveals that NUcache improves the performance over a baseline design by 9.6\%, 30\% and 33\% respectively for dual, quad and eight core workloads comprised of SPEC benchmarks. We also show that NUcache is more effective than other well-known cache-partitioning algorithms.},

To expedite verification and program debugging, chip manufacturers increasingly consider hardware infrastructure for program debugging and tracing, including logic to capture and filter traces, buffers to store traces, and a trace port through which the trace is read by the debug tools. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to capture and compress program execution traces in hardware. The proposed trace compressor encompasses two cost-effective structures, a stream descriptor cache, and a last stream predictor. Information about the program flow is translated into a sequence of hit and miss events in these structures, thus dramatically reducing the number of bits that need to be sent out of the chip. We evaluate the efficiency of the proposed mechanism by measuring the trace port bandwidth on a set of benchmark programs. Our mechanism requires only 0.15 bits/instruction/CPU on average on the trace port, which is a sixfold improvement over state-of-the-art commercial solutions. The trace compressor requires an on-chip area that is equivalent to one third of a 1 kilobyte cache and it allows for continual and unobtrusive program tracing in real time.},

Cache locking is a promising approach for simplifying WCET estimation and providing predictability, and hence, several commercial processors provide ability for locking cache. However, cache locking also has several disadvantages (e.g., extra misses for unlocked blocks, complex algorithms required for selection of locking contents) and hence, a careful management is required to realize the full potential of cache locking. In this article, we present a survey of techniques proposed for cache locking. We categorize the techniques into several groups to underscore their similarities and differences. We also discuss the opportunities and obstacles in using cache locking. We hope that this article will help researchers gain insight into cache locking schemes and will also stimulate further work in this area.},

  abstract = {To improve the performance and energy consumption of chip multiprocessor (CMP) system, memory request serving latencies should be minimized. These latencies can be minimized by scheduling appropriate memory command at appropriate time. This paper proposes a scheduler that reduces latency related to serving memory read requests by delaying switching into write drain mode when memory traffic is not heavy and write queue is not full. Memory reads are more important to handle than memory writes for system's performance. Further precharge and activate operations are performed using constant stride prefetcher. In idle memory cycles the scheduler issues row precharge commands using cache prefetching technique based on Global History Buffer. Authors in [1] have used stride detector and Global History Buffer based speculative precharges and activates, but they treat memory reads and memory writes equally. Whereas, proposed scheduler in this paper prioritizes reads over writes for better system performance. Our evaluations show that proposed scheduling policy significantly outperforms previous schedulers [1], [2] in varied multicore environments in terms of performance as well as energy consumption. Across a wide range of workloads based on PARSEC benchmark suite, proposed policy improves systems performance by 2.51\%, on 2-core, 0.012\% on 4-core environment in comparison to scheduler proposed in [1].},

Non-intrusive observation of the system's behavior is often insufficient to infer the cause of the problem and identify and fix the bug. In this work, we present a novel approach for non-intrusive program tracing aimed at assisting developers in the task of debugging embedded systems at deployment or production stage, where standard debugging tools are usually no longer available. The technique is rooted in cryptography, in particular the area of side-channel attacks. Our proposed technique expands the scope of these cryptographic techniques so that we recover the sequence of operations from power consumption observations (power traces). To this end, we use digital signal processing techniques (in particular, spectral analysis) combined with pattern recognition techniques to determine blocks of source code being executed given the observed power trace. One of the important highlights of our contribution is the fact that the system works on a standard PC, capturing the power traces through the recording input of the sound card. Experimental results are presented and confirm that the approach is viable.},

As technology has made possible significantly larger and faster machines with multiple processors, the relative distance in processor cycles of this memory has increased considerably. Microarchitectural techniques have evolved to share this memory across ever-larger systems of processors with deep cache hierarchies and have managed to hide this latency for many applications, but are proving to be expensive and energy-inefficient for newer types of problems working on massive amounts of data. New paradigms include scale-out systems distributed across hundreds and even thousands of nodes, in-memory databases that keep data in memory much longer than the duration of a single task, and near-data computation, where some of the computation is off-loaded to the location of the data to avoid wasting energy in the movement of data. This paper provides a historical perspective on the evolution of memory architecture, and suggests that the requirements of new problems and new applications are likely to fundamentally change processor and system architecture away from the currently established von Neumann model.},

These CPU-centric designs invest a lot of power and chip area to bridge the widening gap between CPU and main memory speeds. Yet, many large applications do not operate well on these systems and are limited by the memory subsystem performance.This paper argues for an integrated system approach that uses less-powerful CPUs that are tightly integrated with advanced memory technologies to build competitive systems with greatly reduced cost and complexity. Based on a design study using the next generation 0.25¬µm, 256Mbit dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) process and on the analysis of existing machines, we show that processor memory integration can be used to build competitive, scalable and cost-effective MP systems.We present results from execution driven uni- and multi-processor simulations showing that the benefits of lower latency and higher bandwidth can compensate for the restrictions on the size and complexity of the integrated processor. In this system, small direct mapped instruction caches with long lines are very effective, as are column buffer data caches augmented with a victim cache.},

It has also become one of the major key features for efficient memory management from the technological aspect. Hence, owing to the existing critical computing systems, it has become too essential to attain faster processing of executable instructions under any adverse situations. In the current scenario, the state of art processors such as Intel multi-core processors for application specific integrated circuits, usually employ various cache replacement policies such as Least Recently Used (LRU) and Pseudo LRU (pLRU), Round Robin, etc. However, fewer amounts of existing research works are found till date to utter about explicit performance issues associated with the conventional cache replacement algorithms. Therefore, the proposed study intended to carry out a performance evaluation to explore the design space of conventional cache replacement policies under SPEC CPU2000 benchmark suite. It initiates and configures the experimental Simple Scalar toolbox prototype on a wide range of cache sizes. The experimental outcomes obtained from the benchmark suite show that PLRU outperforms the conventional LRU concerning computational complexity and a variety of cache blocks organization.},

  abstract = {This paper formulates and shows how to solve the problem of selecting the cache size and depth of cache pipelining that maximizes the performance of a given instruction-set architecture. The solution combines trace-driven architectural simulations and the timing analysis of the physical implementation of the cache. Increasing cache size tends to improve performance but this improvement is limited because cache access time increases with its size. This trade-off results in an optimization problem we referred to as multilevel optimization, because it requires the simultaneous consideration of two levels of machine abstraction: the architectural level and the physical implementation level. The introduction of pipelining permits the use of larger caches without increasing their apparent access time, however, the bubbles caused by load and branch delays limit this technique. In this paper we also show how multilevel optimization can be applied to pipelined systems if software- and hardware-based strategies are considered for hiding the branch and load delays. The multilevel optimization technique is illustrated with the design of a pipelined cache for a high clock rate MIPS-based architecture. The results of this design exercise show that, because processors with pipelined caches can have shorter CPU cycle times and larger caches, a significant performance advantage is gained by using two or three pipeline stages to fetch data from the cache. Of course, the results are only optimal for the implementation technologies chosen for the design exercise; other choices could result in quite different optimal designs. The exercise is primarily to illustrate the steps in the design of pipelined caches using multilevel optimization; however, it does exemplify the importance of pipelined caches if high clock rate processors are to achieve high performance.},

  abstract = {Modern DRAM devices for the main memory are structured to have multiple banks to satisfy ever-increasing throughput, energy-efficiency, and capacity demands. Due to tight cost constraints, only one row can be buffered (opened) per bank and actively service requests at a time, while the row must be deactivated (closed) before a new row is stored into the row buffers. Hasty deactivation unnecessarily re-opens rows for otherwise row-buffer hits while hindsight accompanies the deactivation process on the critical path of accessing data for row-buffer misses. The time to (de)activate a row is comparable to the time to read an open row while applications are often sensitive to DRAM latency. Hence, it is critical to make the right decision on when to close a row. However, the increasing number of banks per DRAM device over generations reduces the number of requests per bank. This forces a memory controller to frequently predict when to close a row due to a lack of information on future requests, while the dynamic nature of memory access patterns limits the prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel DRAM microarchitecture that can eliminate the need for any prediction. First, we identify that precharging the bitlines dominates the deactivate time, while sense amplifiers that work as a row buffer are physically coupled with the bitlines such that a single command precharges both bitlines and sense amplifiers simultaneously. By decoupling the bitlines from the row buffers using isolation transistors, the bitlines can be precharged right after a row becomes activated. Therefore, only the sense amplifiers need to be precharged for a miss in most cases, taking an order of magnitude shorter time than the conventional deactivation process. Second, we show that this row-buffer decoupling enables internal DRAM Œº-operations to be separated and recombined, which can be exploited by memory controllers to make the main memory system more energy efficient. Our experiments demonstrate that row-buffer decoupling improves the geometric mean of the instructions per cycle and MIPS2/W by 14\% and 29\%, respectively, for memory-intensive SPEC CPU2006 applications.},

We have developed simple compiler heuristics to identify load instructions that are likely to cause a cache-miss. Experimentation with a set of SPEC92 benchmarks shows that our heuristics are successful in identifying 85\% of cache misses.

An accurate prefetcher improves system performance whereas an inaccurate prefetcher can cause cache pollution and consume additional bandwidth. Prefetch address filtering techniques improve prefetch accuracy by predicting the usefulness of a prefetch address and based on the outcome of the prediction, the prefetcher decides whether or not to issue a prefetch request. Existing techniques use only one signature to predict the usefulness of a prefetcher but no single predictor works well across all the applications. In this work, we propose weighted-majority filter, an expert way of predicting the usefulness of prefetch addresses. The proposed filter is adaptive in nature and uses the prediction of the best predictor(s) from a pool of predictors. Our filter is orthogonal to the underlying prefetching algorithm. We evaluate the effectiveness of our technique on 22 SPEC-2000/2006 applications. On an average, when employed with three state-of-the-art prefetchers such as AMPM, SMS, and GHB-PC/DC, our filter provides performance improvement of 8.1, 9.3, and 11 percent respectively.},

  abstract = {Cache is one of the most power-consuming components in computer architecture. Power reduction in cache can be achieved by reducing miss rate, miss penalty, latency per access, and power consumption per access. The power reduction can also be achieved by shutting down unused part of the cache, by allowing not so recently used cache banks to sleep, reconfiguring the cache for specific application and various combinations of one or more of these. The cache hit depends on the cache size, associativity and the cache line size. Replacement strategies in associative mapping schemes play an important role in cache hit rate performance. This survey paper proposes a classification of these strategies with detailed discussion on their advantages and disadvantages.},

We focus on the 3D integration of one VLIW processor die with multiple high-capacity DRAM dies. Our proposed memory architecture employs 3D stacking technology to bond one die containing several processing clusters to multiple DRAM dies for a primary memory. The 3D technology also enables wide low-latency buses between clusters and memory and enable the latency of 3D DRAM L2 cache comparable to 2D SRAM L2 cache. These enable it to replace the 2D SRAM L2 cache with 3D DRAM L2 cache. The die area for 2D SRAM L2 cache can be re-allocated to additional clusters that can improve the performance of the system. From the simulation results, we find 3D stacking DRAM main memory can improve the system performance by 10\% 80\% than 2D off-chip DRAM main memory depending on different benchmarks. Also, for a similar logic die area, a four clusters system with 3D DRAM L2 cache and 3D DRAM main memory outperforms a two clusters system with 2D SRAM L2 cache and 3D DRAM main memory by about 10\%.},

  abstract = {WWCLOCK: Page Replacement Algorithm Considering Asymmetric I/O Cost of Flash Memory Buffer Cache Replacement Algorithm;Cost-aware;Heterogeneous storage; Flash memories have asymmetric I/O costs for read and write in terms of latency and energy consumption. However, the ratio of these costs is dependent on the type of storage. Moreover, it is becoming more common to use two flash memories on a system as an internal memory and an external memory card. For this reason, buffer cache replacement algorithms should consider I/O costs of device as well as possibility of reference. This paper presents WWCLOCK(Write-Weighted CLOCK) algorithm which directly uses I/O costs of devices along with recency and frequency of cache blocks to selecting a victim to evict from the buffer cache. WWCLOCK can be used for wide range of storage devices with different I/O cost and for systems that are using two or more memory devices at the same time. In addition to this, it has low time and space complexity comparable to CLOCK algorithm. Trace-driven simulations show that the proposed algorithm reduces the total I/O time compared with LRU by 36.2\% on average.},

One common approach for improving the retrieval rate of large, distributed documents is via caching. In this paper, we present a caching algorithm that flexibly adapt its parameters to the hit rates and access patterns of users requesting documents. The algorithm is derived from an analysis of user accesses in a WWW database. In particular, the analysis is based upon a model from psychological research on human memory, which has long studied retrieval of memory items based on frequency and recency rates of past item occurrences. Results show that the model predicts document access with a high degree of accuracy. Furthermore, the model indicates that a caching algorithm based upon the recency rates of prior document access will reliably handle future document requests. The algorithm presented is simple, robust, and easily implementable.},

To find software bugs faster, developers often rely on on-chip trace and debug resources. However, these resources offer limited visibility of the system, increase the system cost, and do not scale well with a growing number of processor cores. This paper introduces a new hardware/software mechanism for capturing and filtering load data value traces in multicores that enables a complete reconstruction of a parallel program execution. The proposed mechanism exploits data caches and cache coherence protocol states to minimize the number of trace events that are necessary to stream out of the target platform to the software debugger. The mechanism relies on a single trace bit per data cache block, thus minimizing the cost of hardware implementation. Our experimental evaluation explores the effectiveness of the proposed technique by measuring the trace port bandwidth as a function of the cache size and the number of processor cores. The results show that the proposed mechanism significantly reduces the required trace port bandwidth when compared to the Nexus-like load data value tracing. Depending on data cache size, the improvements range from 9.9 to 23.5 times for single cores and from 18.6 to 37.3 times for octa cores.},

However, they are sources of predictability problems because of their dynamic and adaptive behavior, and thus need special attention to be used in hard real-time systems. A lot of progress has been achieved in the last ten years to statically predict worst-case execution times (WCETs) of tasks on architectures with caches. However, cache-aware WCET analysis techniques are not always applicable due to the lack of documentation of hardware manuals concerning the cache replacement policies. Moreover, they tend to be pessimistic with some cache replacement policies (e.g. random replacement policies) [6]. Lastly, caches are sources of timing anomalies in dynamically scheduled processors [13] (a cache miss may in some cases result in a shorter execution time than a hit).},

Different factors are behind the high latency of advance digital systems. Approaches like array binding and allocation, code rewriting, and others are adopted to reduce the overall latency of these systems. In this paper, we explore new dimensions to achieve maximum latency optimization in applications that involve extensive memory access. The proposed algorithm of idle/slack time management utilizes empty slots in memory access of different memory modules by appropriately activating upcoming commands in advance. The optimization of latency is further increased by incorporating the multi-way conflict resolution algorithm in second stage and followed by the use of advance dynamic buffers in third stage. Our successive three stages approach of adopting slack time management, multi-way partitioning using min-cut algorithm, and the use of advance dynamic buffers yields better results. Comparison of the experimental results with different benchmarks shows that our proposed technique optimizes the existing page-mode technique by 9\%. Hence, adopting this proposed optimization strategy significantly reduces overall latency of modern digital systems.},

The widening latency gap between high speed cores and main memory has led to the evolution of multi-level caches and using DRAM as the Last-Level-Cache (LLC). The main problem of employing DRAM cache is their high tag lookup latency. If DRAM cache misses, the latency of memory access will be increased comparing with the system without DRAM cache. To solve this problem, we propose an effective predictor to Reduce DRAM Cache Access (RCA) in cache miss. The predictor composes of a saturating counter and a Partial MissMap (P\_Map). If the saturating counter indicates a hit, then the request will be send to the P\_Map to further lookup whether it is a hit or not. The evaluation results show that RCA can improve system performance by 8.2\% and 3.4\% on average, compared to MissMap and MAP\_G, respectively.},

  abstract = {While hardware caches are generally effective at improving application performance, they greatly complicate performance prediction. Slight changes in memory layout or data access patterns can lead to large and systematic increases in cache misses, degrading performance. In the worst case, these misses can effectively render the cache useless. These pathological cases, or ‚Äúcache risk patterns‚Äù, are difficult to predict, test or debug, and their presence limits the usefulness of caches in safety critical real-time systems, especially in hard real-time environments.},

  abstract = {Performance loss due to long-latency memory accesses can be reduced by servicing multiple memory accesses concurrently. The notion of generating and servicing long-latency cache misses in parallel is called Memory Level Parallelism (MLP). MLP is not uniform across cache misses - some misses occur in isolation while some occur in parallel with other misses. Isolated misses are more costly on performance than parallel misses. However, traditional cache replacement is not aware of the MLP-dependent cost differential between different misses. Cache replacement, if made MLP-aware, can improve performance by reducing the number of performance-critical isolated misses. This paper makes two key contributions. First, it proposes a framework for MLP-aware cache replacement by using a runtime technique to compute the MLP-based cost for each cache miss. It then describes a simple cache replacement mechanism that takes both MLP-based cost and recency into account. Second, it proposes a novel, low-hardware overhead mechanism called Sampling Based Adaptive Replacement (SBAR), to dynamically choose between an MLP-aware and a traditional replacement policy, depending on which one is more effective at reducing the number of memory related stalls. Evaluations with the SPEC CPU2000 benchmarks show that MLP-aware cache replacement can improve performance by as much as 23\%.},

As a consequence, an L2 cache with LRU replacement incurs significantly higher misses than the optimal replacement policy (OPT). We propose to narrow this gap through a novel replacement strategy that mimics the replacement decisions of OPT. The L2 cache is logically divided into two components, a Shepherd Cache (SC) with a simple FIFO replacement and a Main Cache (MC) with an emulation of optimal replacement. The SC plays the dual role of caching lines and guiding the replacement decisions in MC. Our proposed organization can cover 40\% of the gap between OPT and LRU for a 2MB cache resulting in 7\% overall speedup. Comparison with the dynamic insertion policy, a victim buffer, a V-Way cache and an LRU based fully associative cache demonstrates that our scheme performs better than all these strategies.},

We propose the use of an intelligent, adaptive cache management technique to overcome the coherence problem by using document life h stories to optimise cache performance. This work addresses the use of damped exponential smoothing to model accurately the frequency of file requests and modifications, in order to predict the future value of cached files. Finally, we make a mathematical analysis of LRU in comparison with our technique, showing how and why the use of document lif histories is a more effective cache management technique without imposing major computational overheads.},

There is nearly an order of magnitude difference in bandwidth between successive references to different columns within a row and different rows within a bank. This paper introduces memory access scheduling, a technique that improves the performance of a memory system by reordering memory references to exploit locality within the 3-D memory structure. Conservative reordering, in which the first ready reference in a sequence is performed, improves bandwidth by 40\% for traces from five media benchmarks. Aggressive reordering, in which operations are scheduled to optimize memory bandwidth, improves bandwidth by 93\% for the same set of applications. Memory access scheduling is particularly important for media processors where it enables the processor to make the most efficient use of scarce memory bandwidth.},

We describe a replacement algorithm based on the concept of maintaining reference counts in which locality has been ‚Äúfactored out‚Äù. In this algorithm replacement choices are made using a combination of reference frequency and block age. Simulation results based on traces of file system and I/O activity from actual systems show that this algorithm can offer up to 34\% performance improvement over LRU replacement, where the improvement is expressed as the fraction of the performance gain achieved between LRU replacement and the theoretically optimal policy in which the reference string must be known in advance. Furthermore, the implementation complexity and efficiency of this algorithm is comparable to one using LRU replacement.},

Often execution times and events are not easily countable or measurable due to a lack of functionality in these systems. Execution time monitoring is also relevant in terms of reacting to internal and external events dynamically.Especially for systems using multiple tasks with internal or external resource dependencies, this is a major discipline. Another problem is that measurements during the development process are often done by interfering the system as a whole. This method leads to biases in the measurement results, because the finalized system gets deployed without these interfering functionalities and can therefore work more efficiently than the development system.The scope of the present work is to develop a module in a hardware description language (HDL) which is able to measure execution times and events task-aware and unaware without interfering the system. The measurements of this module must be handed to the programmer through an easy accessible interface. The main focuses of the project are the scalability, platform independency concerning processor and operating system (OS), as well as easy extendibility. Also, reusability of counters during runtime is included in this work.},

  abstract = {Many data structures (e.g., matrices) are typically accessed with multiple access patterns. Depending on the layout of the data structure in physical address space, some access patterns result in non-unit strides. In existing systems, which are optimized to store and access cache lines, non-unit strided accesses exhibit low spatial locality. Therefore, they incur high latency, and waste memory bandwidth and cache space. We propose the Gather-Scatter DRAM (GS-DRAM) to address this problem. We observe that a commodity DRAM module contains many chips. Each chip stores a part of every cache line mapped to the module. Our idea is to enable the memory controller to access multiple values that belong to a strided pattern from different chips using a single read/write command. To realize this idea, GS-DRAM first maps the data of each cache line to different chips such that multiple values of a strided access pattern are mapped to different chips. Second, instead of sending a separate address to each chip, GS-DRAM maps each strided pattern to a small pattern ID that is communicated to the module. Based on the pattern ID, each chip independently computes the address of the value to be accessed. The cache line returned by the module contains different values of the strided pattern gathered from different chips. We show that this approach enables GS-DRAM to achieve near-ideal memory bandwidth and cache utilization for many common access patterns. We design an end-to-end system to exploit GS-DRAM. Our evaluations show that 1) for in-memory databases, GS-DRAM obtains the best of the row store and the column store layouts, in terms of both performance and energy, and 2) for matrix-matrix multiplication, GS-DRAM seamlessly enables SIMD optimizations and outperforms the best tiled layout. Our framework is general, and can benefit many modern data-intensive applications.},

  abstract = {Utilizing the nonuniform latencies of SDRAM devices, access reordering mechanisms alter the sequence of main memory access streams to reduce the observed access latency. Using a revised M5 simulator with an accurate SDRAM module, the burst scheduling access reordering mechanism is proposed and compared to conventional in order memory scheduling as well as existing academic and industrial access reordering mechanisms. With burst scheduling, memory accesses to the same rows of the same banks are clustered into bursts to maximize bus utilization of the SDRAM device. Subject to a static threshold, memory reads are allowed to preempt ongoing writes for reduced read latency, while qualified writes are piggybacked at the end of bursts to exploit row locality in writes and prevent write queue saturation. Performance improvements contributed by read preemption and write piggybacking are identified. Simulation results show that burst scheduling reduces the average execution time of selected SPEC CPU2000 benchmarks by 21\% over conventional bank in order memory scheduling. Burst scheduling also outperforms Intel's patented out of order memory scheduling and the row hit access reordering mechanism by 11\% and 6\% respectively},

However, DRAM vendors are strongly reluctant to decrease DRAM latency due to the additional manufacturing cost. Therefore, we set our goal to reduce DRAM latency without any modification in the existing DRAM structure. To accomplish our goal, we focus on an intrinsic phenomenon in DRAM: electric charge variation in DRAM cell capacitors. Then, we draw two key insights: i) DRAM row-access latency of a row is a function of the elapsed time from when the row was last refreshed, and ii) DRAM row-access latency of a row is also a function of the remaining time until the row is next refreshed. Based on these two insights, we propose two mechanisms to reduce DRAM latency: NUAT-1 and NUAT-2. NUAT-1 exploits the first key insight and NUAT-2 exploits the second key insight. For evaluation, circuit- and system-level simulations are performed, which show the performance improvement for various environments.},

DRAM, a main memory in most computers, has concentrated only on capacity and bandwidth for decades to achieve high performance computing. However, DRAM access latency should also be considered to keep the development trend in multi-core era. Therefore, we propose NUAT which is a new memory controller focusing on reducing memory access latency without any modification of the existing DRAM structure. We only exploit DRAM's intrinsic phenomenon: electric charge variation in DRAM cell capacitors. Given the cost-sensitive DRAM market, it is a big advantage in terms of actual implementation. NUAT gives a score to every memory access request and the request with the highest score obtains a priority. For scoring, we introduce two new concepts: Partitioned Bank Rotation (PBR) and PBR Page Mode (PPM). First, PBR is a mechanism that draws information of access speed from refresh timing and position; the request which has faster access speed gains higher score. Second, PPM selects a better page mode between open- and close-page modes based on the information from PBR. Evaluations show that NUAT decreases memory access latency significantly for various environments.},

  abstract = {The relatively high latency of DRAM is mostly caused by the long row-activation time which in fact consists of sensing and restoring time. Memory controllers cannot distinguish between them since they are performed consecutively by a single row-activation command. If these two steps are separated, the restoring can be delayed until DRAM access is uncongested. Hence, we propose Quick-Access DRAM (Q-DRAM) which discriminates between sensing and restoring. Our approach is to allow destructive access (i.e., only sensing is performed without restoring by a row-activation command) using per-bank multiple row-buffers. We call the destructive access and per-bank multiple row-buffers quick-access and quick-buffers (q-buffers) respectively. In addition, we propose Quick-access Trigger (Q-TRIGGER) and RESTORER to utilize Q-DRAM. Q-TRIGGER makes a decision whether quick-access is required or not, and RESTORER decides when to restore the data at the destructed cell. Specifically, RESTORER detects the proper timing to hide restoring time by predicting data bus occupation and by exploiting bank-level locality. Evaluations show that Q-DRAM significantly improved performance for both single- and multi-core systems.},

In this paper, we develop a proactive caching framework that utilizes the predictability of the mobile user behavior to offload predictable traffic through the WiFi networks ahead of time. First, we formulate the proactive scheduling problem with the objective of maximizing the user-content hit ratio subject to constrains stemming from the user behavioral models. Second, we propose a quadratic-complexity (in the number of slots per day) greedy, yet, high performance heuristic algorithm that pinpoints the best download slot for each content item to attain maximal hit ratio. We confirm the merits of the proposed scheme based on the traces of a real dataset leveraging a large number of smart phone users who consistently utilized our framework for two months.},

These traditional efforts perform either on-the-fly processing or use design-time analyzed results. However, on-the-fly processing often leads to low-quality mappings, and design-time analysis becomes computationally costly for large-size problems and require huge storage for large number of applications. In this paper, we present a novel run-time mapping approach, where identification of an efficient mapping for a use-case is done by the online execution trace analysis of the active applications. The trace analysis facilitates for fast identification of the mapping while optimizing for the system resource usage and throughput of the active applications, leading to reduced energy consumption as well. By rapidly identifying the efficient mapping at run-time, the proposed approach overcomes the mappings‚Äô exploration time bottleneck for large-size problems and their storage overhead problem when compared to the traditional approaches. Our experiments show that on average the exploration time to identify the mapping is reduced 14√ó when compared to stateof-the-art approaches and storage overhead is reduced by 92\%. Additionally, energy and resource savings are achieved along with identification of high-quality mapping.},

In this approach, a user thread runs on a general-purpose processor in main memory, either in the memory controller chip or in a DRAM chip. The thread performs correlation prefetching in software, sending the prefetched data into the L2 cache of the main processor. This approach requires minimal hardware beyond the memory processor: the correlation table is a software data structure that resides in the main memory, while the main processor only needs a few modifications to its L2 cache so that it can accept incoming prefetches. In addition, the approach has wide usability, as it can effectively prefetch even for irregular applications. Finally, it is very flexible, as the prefetching algorithm can be customized by the user on an application basis. Our simulation results show that, through a new design of the correlation table and prefetching algorithm, our scheme delivers good results. Specifically, nine mostly-irregular applications show an average speedup of 1.32. Furthermore, our scheme works well in combination with a conventional processor-side sequential prefetcher, in which case the average speedup increases to 1.46. Finally, by exploiting the customization of the prefetching algorithm, we increase the average speed up to 1.53.},

The evaluation is done using SimpleScalar simulation tools based on its Alpha version. We select some benchmarks for this study based on some previous researches about the clustering of SPEC CPU2000 benchmark suite. The contribution of this work is identifying important parameters for cache design in general-purpose embedded systems. Our results show that the Pseudo LRU techniques for cache replacement, such as MRU can approximate LRU with much lower complexity for a wide variety of cache sizes and degree of associativities},

  abstract = {The cache replacement policy is a major factor which determines the effectiveness of memory hierarchy. The replacement policy affects both the hit rate and the access latency of the cache. It decides the cache block to be replaced to give room for the incoming block. The replacement policy has to be chosen in such a way that the cache misses are reduced. Last level cache misses causes hundreds of stall cycles due to the need for main memory access. So last level cache misses are given more priority over L1 cache misses. The traditional cache replacement policy used is Least Recently Used (LRU) policy. LRU policy favors workloads having cyclic access pattern which fit in cache, but it exhibit thrashing behavior for memory-intensive workloads that does not fit in the available cache. Hence, many replacement policies were proposed to improve the miss rate for last level caches while maintaining low hardware overhead and minimum design changes. Here a novel replacement policy which is a variation of LRU Insertion policy (LIP) based on re-reference count is proposed. The promotion policy in LIP is modified to implement the new policy which is based on the re-reference count. The proposed replacement policy was implemented and performance comparisons of the replacement policies were done on Gem5 simulator using cpu2006 benchmarks. Under this policy, the memory intensive workload mcf attains 64\% improvement in L2 cache miss rate over LRU policy.},

They enable hiding the latencies when accessing cache or main memory. Recently the technique of using temporal parameters of cache memory accesses and tag patterns observing has been applied by some authors for prediction of data prefetching. In this paper a possibility of applying analog techniques on controlling DRAM rows opening/closing, is being researched. Obtained results confirm such a possibility, in a form of a complete predictor, which predicts not only when to close the currently open row but also which is the next row to be opened. Using such a predictor can decrease the average DRAM latency, which is very important in many areas, including telecommunications},

  abstract = {We present and evaluate the idea of adaptive processor cache management. Specifically, we describe a novel and general scheme by which we can combine any two cache management algorithms (e.g., LRU, LFU, FIFO, Random) and adaptively switch between them, closely tracking the locality characteristics of a given program. The scheme is inspired by recent work in virtual memory management at the operating system level, which has shown that it is possible to adapt over two replacement policies to provide an aggregate policy that always performs within a constant factor of the better component policy. A hardware implementation of adaptivity requires very simple logic but duplicate tag structures. To reduce the overhead, we use partial tags, which achieve good performance with a small hardware cost. In particular, adapting between LRU and LFU replacement policies on an 8-way 512KB L2 cache yields a 12.7\% improvement in average CPI on applications that exhibit a non-negligible L2 miss ratio. Our approach increases total cache storage by 4.0\%, but it still provides slightly better performance than a conventional 10-way setassociative 640KB cache which requires 25\% more storage.},

To access one cache block, an entire row needs to be sensed and amplified, data restored into the bitcells and the bitlines precharged, incurring high latency. Isolating the bitlines and sense amplifiers after activation enables reads and precharges to happen in parallel. However, there are challenges in achieving this isolation. We tackle these challenges and propose an effective scheme, simultaneous read and precharge (SRP), to isolate the sense amplifiers and bitlines and serve reads and precharges in parallel. Our detailed architecture and circuit simulations demonstrate that our simultaneous read and precharge (SRP) mechanism is able to achieve an 8.6\% performance benefit over baseline, while reducing sense amplifier idle power by 30\%, as compared to prior work, over a wide range of workloads.},

  abstract = {In the high-associativity caches, the hardware overheads of the cache replacement policy become a problem. To avoid this problem, the Adaptive Demotion Policy (ADP) is proposed. The ADP focuses on the priority value demotion at a cache miss, and it can achieve a higher performance compared with conventional cache replacement policies. The ADP can be implemented with small hardware resources, and the priority value update logic can be implemented with a small hardware cost. The ADP can suit for various applications by the appropriate selection of its insertion, promotion and selection policies. If the dynamic selection of the suitable policies for the running application is possible, the performance of the cache replacement policy will be increased. In order to achieve the dynamic selection of the suitable policies, this paper focuses on the global fluctuations of the priority values. At first, the cache is partitioned into several partitions. At every cache access, the total of priority values in each partition is calculated. At every set interval, the fluctuations of total priority values in all the partitions are checked, and the information is used to detect the behavior of the application. This paper adapts this mechanism to the ADP, and the adapted cache replacement policy is called the ADP-G. The performance evaluation shows that the ADP-G achieves the MPKI reductions and the IPC improvements, compared to the LRU policy, the RRIP policy and the ADP.},

The stacking memory adopts three-dimensional (3D) IC technology, which leverages through-silicon-vias (TSVs) to connect layers, to dramatically reduce the access latency and improve the bandwidth without the constraint of I/O pins. To demonstrate the feasibility of 3D memory stacking, this paper introduces a customized 3D Double-Data-Rate (DDR) SDRAM controller design, which communicates with DRAM layers by TSVs. In addition, we propose a parallel access policy to further improve the performance. The 3D DDR controller is integrated in a 3D stacking System-on-Chip (SoC) architecture, where a high-bandwidth 3D DRAM chip is stacked on the top. The 3D SoC is divided into two logic layers with each having an area of 2.5 √ó 5.0mm2, with a 3-layer 2Gb DRAM stacking. The whole chip has been fabricated in Chartered 130nm low-power process and Tezzaron's 3D bonding technology. The simulation result shows that the on-chip DRAM controller can run as fast as 133MHz and provide 4.25GB/s data bandwidth in a single channel and 8.5GB/s with parallel access policy.},

  abstract = {Software testing and debugging has become the most critical aspect of the development of modern embedded systems, mainly driven by growing software and hardware complexity, increasing integration, and tightening time-to-market deadlines. Software developers increasingly rely on on-chip trace and debug infrastructure to locate software bugs faster. However, the existing infrastructure offers limited visibility or relies on hefty on-chip buffers and wide trace ports that significantly increase system cost. This paper introduces a new technique called mcfTRaptor for capturing and compressing functional and time-stamped control-flow traces on-the-fly in modern multicore systems. It relies on private on-chip predictor structures and corresponding software modules in the debugger to significantly reduce the number of events that needs to be streamed out of the target platform. Our experimental evaluation explores the effectiveness of mcfTRaptor as a function of the number of cores, encoding mechanisms, and predictor configurations. When compared to the Nexus-like control-flow tracing, mcfTRaptor reduces the trace port bandwidth in the range from 14 to 23.8 times for functional traces and 10.8‚Äì18.6 times for time-stamped traces.},

A novel method of routing the internal memory bus using TSVs and fan-out buffers enables 3D-Wiz to use smaller dimension subarrays without significant area overhead. This in turn reduces the random access latency and activation-precharge energy. 3D-Wiz demonstrates access latency of 19.5ns and row cycle time of 25ns. It yields per access activation energy and precharge energy of 0.78nJ and 0.62nJ respectively with 42.5\% area efficiency. 3D-Wiz yields the best latency and energy consumption values per access among other well-known 3D DRAM architectures. Experimental results with PARSEC benchmarks indicate that 3D-Wiz achieves 38.8\% improvement in performance, 81.1\% reduction in power consumption, and 77.1\% reduction in energy-delay product (EDP) on average over 3D DRAM architectures from prior work.},

  abstract = {Belady‚Äôs optimal cache replacement policy is an algorithm to work out the theoretical minimum number of cache misses, but the rationale behind it was too simple. In this work, we revisit the essential function of caches to develop an underlying analytical model. We argue that frequency and recency are the only two affordable attributes of cache history that can be leveraged to predict a good replacement. Based on those two properties, we propose a novel replacement policy, the Effectiveness-Based Replacement policy (EBR) and a refinement, Dynamic EBR (D-EBR), which combines measures of recency and frequency to form a rank sequence inside each set and evict blocks with lowest rank. To evaluate our design, we simulated all 30 applications from SPEC CPU2006 for uni-core system and a set of combinations for 4-core systems, for different cache sizes. The results show that EBR achieves an average miss rate reduction of 12.4\%. With the help of D-EBR, we can tune the weight ratio between ‚Äòfrequency‚Äô and ‚Äòrecency‚Äô dynamically. D-EBR can nearly double the miss reduction achieved by EBR alone. In terms of hardware overhead, EBR requires half the hardware overhead of real LRU and even compared with Pseudo LRU the overhead is modest.},

  abstract = {Caches are traditionally organized as a rigid hierarchy, with multiple levels of progressively larger and slower memories. Hierarchy allows a simple, fixed design to benefit a wide range of applications, since working sets settle at the smallest (i.e., fastest and most energy-efficient) level they fit in. However, rigid hierarchies also add overheads, because each level adds latency and energy even when it does not fit the working set. These overheads are expensive on emerging systems with heterogeneous memories, where the differences in latency and energy across levels are small. Significant gains are possible by specializing the hierarchy to applications. We propose Jenga, a reconfigurable cache hierarchy that dynamically and transparently specializes itself to applications. Jenga builds virtual cache hierarchies out of heterogeneous, distributed cache banks using simple hardware mechanisms and an OS runtime. In contrast to prior techniques that trade energy and bandwidth for performance (e.g., dynamic bypassing or prefetching), Jenga eliminates accesses to unwanted cache levels. Jenga thus improves both performance and energy efficiency. On a 36-core chip with a 1 GB DRAM cache, Jenga improves energy-delay product over a combination of state-of-the-art techniques by 23\% on average and by up to 85\%.},

On the other hand, the pressures of area and cost lead to the requirement for a single, shared off-chip DRAM memory subsystem. To satisfy different memory access requirements (for latency and bandwidth) of these heterogeneous functions to this kind of DRAM memory subsystem, a quality-aware memory controller is important. The paper presents an efficient memory controller that contains a quality-aware scheduler and a configurable DRAM memory interface socket to achieve high DRAM utilization while still meeting different requirements for bandwidth and latency.

It focuses on systems where a single chip DRAM/processor will not be feasible even in 10 years, e.g. systems requiring a large memory and/or many CPU's. In such systems a solution needs to be found to DRAM latency and bandwidth as well as to inter-chip communication. Utilizing the projected advances in chip I/O bandwidth we propose to implement a decoupled access-execute processor where the access processor is placed in memory. A program is compiled to run as a computational process and several access processes with the latter executing in the DRAM processors. Instruction set extensions are discussed to support this paradigm. Using multi-level branch prediction the access processor stays ahead of the execute processor and keeps the latter supplied with data. The system reduces latency by moving address computation to memory and thus avoiding sending address to memory by the computational processor. This and the fetch-ahead capabilities of the access processor are combined with multiple DRAM "streaming" to improve performance. DRAM caching is assumed to be used to assist in this as well.},

Low overhead is particularly important in embedded systems where resources and energy consumption is critical. The most advanced tracing infrastructures achieve a very low footprint on the traced software, bringing each tracepoint overhead to less than a microsecond. To reduce this still non-negligible impact, the use of dedicated hardware resources is promising. In this paper, we propose complementary methods for tracing that rely on hardware modules to assist software tracing. We designed solutions to take advantage of CoreSight STM, CoreSight ETM, and Intel BTS, which are present on most newer ARM-based systems-on-chip and Intel x86 processors. Our results show that the time overhead for tracing can be reduced by up to 10 times when assisted by hardware, as compared to software tracing with LTTng, a high-performance tracer for Linux. We also propose a modification to the Perf tool to speed BTS execution tracing up to 65\%.},

  abstract = {The emerging die-stacked DRAM technology allows computer architects to design a last-level cache (LLC) with high memory bandwidth and large capacity. There are four key requirements for DRAM cache design: minimizing on-chip tag storage overhead, optimizing access latency, improving hit rate, and reducing off-chip traffic. These requirements seem mutually incompatible. For example, to reduce the tag storage overhead, the recent proposed LH-cache co-locates tags and data in the same DRAM cache row, and the Alloy Cache proposed to alloy data and tags in the same cache line in a direct-mapped design. However, these ideas either require significant tag lookup latency or sacrifice hit rate for hit latency. To optimize all four key requirements, we propose the Buffered Way Predictor (BWP). The BWP predicts the way ID of a DRAM cache request with high accuracy and coverage, allowing data and tag to be fetched back to back. Thus, the read latency for the data can be completely hidden so that DRAM cache hitting requests have low access latency. The BWP technique is designed for highly associative block-based DRAM caches and achieves a low miss rate and low off-chip traffic. Our evaluation with multi-programmed workloads and a 128MB DRAM cache shows that a 128KB BWP achieves a 76.2\% hit rate. The BWP improves performance by 8.8\% and 12.3\% compared to LH-cache and Alloy Cache, respectively.},

  abstract = {Modern processors mostly use cache to hide the memory access latency, so cache performance is very important to application program. A detailed cache performance analysis will provide programmers a clear view of their program behaviors, which can help them to identify the performance bottleneck and to optimize the source code. As the chip industry turn to integrate multiple cores into one chip, multi-core/many-core processor becomes the new approach to maintain the Moor's Law. Therefore, Parallel programs turn to be more important even in the personal computers. In parallel programs, the interaction between tasks is the source of bugs and errors and is hard to handling for most of programmers. The detailed cache behaviors will greatly helpful to the programmer to find the errors and optimize the programs. However, the existing cache performance analysis tools, due to the limitations of the hardware performance counters they depend on to get data, cannot get as much data as we expected. Those tools cannot reveal the program routines characteristics on shared cache and the source of cache misses with limited metrics on cache misses. In this paper, we propose a method to obtain and analysis real time cache performance with binary instrumentation and cache emulation. We instrument the parallel program while it is running, and get the trace data about memory access. Then we transport the trace data to an carefully configured cache emulation module to get the detailed cache behavior information. The emulation module can not only get more information than hardware performance counter but also can be configured to simulate different target hardware environment. Additionally, we use the performance data to form a group of cache performance metrics which can intuitively help programmers to optimize their codes. The accuracy of this method is demonstrated by comparing the summary result with the hardware performance counter. Finally, we design an cache performance analysis tool named CC-Analyzer for parallel programs. Comparing with the existing technologies, CC-Analyzer is able to analyze the cause of cache misses and gather much more performance statistics when the parallel program is running on different cache architectures.},

  abstract = {Long DRAM access latency is a major bottleneck for system performance. In order to access data in DRAM, a memory controller (1) activates (i.e., opens) a row of DRAM cells in a cell array, (2) restores the charge in the activated cells back to their full level, (3) performs read and write operations to the activated row, and (4) precharges the cell array to prepare for the next activation. The restoration operation is responsible for a large portion (up to 43.6\%) of the total DRAM access latency. We find two frequent cases where the restoration operations performed by DRAM do not need to fully restore the charge level of the activated DRAM cells, which we can exploit to reduce the restoration latency. First, DRAM rows are periodically refreshed (i.e., brought back to full charge) to avoid data loss due to charge leakage from the cell. The charge level of a DRAM row that will be refreshed soon needs to be only partially restored, providing just enough charge so that the refresh can correctly detect the cells' data values. Second, the charge level of a DRAM row that will be activated again soon can be only partially restored, providing just enough charge for the activation to correctly detect the data value. However, partial restoration needs to be done carefully: for a row that will be activated again soon, restoring to only the minimum possible charge level can undermine the benefits of complementary mechanisms that reduce the activation time of highly-charged rows. To enable effective latency reduction for both activation and restoration, we propose charge-level-aware look-ahead partial restoration (CAL). CAL consists of two key components. First, CAL accurately predicts the next access time, which is the time between the current restoration operation and the next activation of the same row. Second, CAL uses the predicted next access time and the next refresh time to reduce the restoration time, ensuring that the amount of partial charge restoration is enough to maintain the benefits of reducing the activation time of a highly-charged row. We implement CAL fully in the memory controller, without any changes to the DRAM module. Across a wide variety of applications, we find that CAL improves the average performance of an 8-core system by 14.7\%, and reduces average DRAM energy consumption by 11.3\%.},

  abstract = {Modern embedded platforms contain a variety of physical resources, such as caches, interconnects, main memory, etc., which the processor must access during the execution of a task. We argue that processor task execution and accesses to physical resources should be co-scheduled in real-time systems to predictably hide resource access latency. In particular, in this work we focus on co-scheduling task execution and accesses to main memory to hide DRAM access latency. Since modern systems implement DMA controllers that can be operated independently of processor execution, this allows us to hide memory transfer latency by scheduling DMA transfer in parallel with processor execution. The main contribution of this paper is a dynamic scheduling algorithm for a set of sporadic real-time tasks that efficiently co-schedules processor and DMA execution to hide memory transfer latency. The proposed algorithm can be applied to either uniprocessor or partitioned multiprocessor systems. We demonstrate that we improve processor utilization significantly compared to existing scratchpad and cache management systems.},

In this paper, we propose a new level 1 (L1) data cache replacement algorithm, Protected Round-Robin (PRR) that is simple enough to be incorporated into embedded processors while providing miss rates that are very similar to the miss rates of LRU. Our experiments showed that on average the miss rates of PRR are only 0.22\% higher than the miss rates of LRU on a 32KB, 4-way L1 data cache with 32 byte long cache lines.

Large cache blocks can improve performance, but only when coupled with wide memory channels. DRAM address mappings also affect performance significantly. We evaluate an aggressive prefetch unit integrated with the L2 cache and memory, controllers. By issuing prefetches only when the Rambus channels are idle, prioritizing them to maximize DRAM row buffer hits, and giving them low replacement priority, we achieve a 43\% speedup across 10 of the 26 SPEC2000 benchmarks, without degrading performance an the others. With eight Rambus channels, these ten benchmarks improve to within 10\% of the performance of a perfect L2 cache.},

Compared to DRAM, NVMs generally have longer latencies and higher energies for writes, which makes careful data placement essential for efficient system operation. Data placement strategies that resort to monitoring all data accesses and migrating objects to dynamically adjust data locations incur high monitoring overhead and unnecessary memory copies due to mispredicted migrations. We find that program semantics (specifically, global access characteristics) can effectively guide initial data placement with respect to memory types, which, in turn, makes run-time migration more efficient. We study a combined offline/online placement scheme that uses access profiling information to place objects statically and then selectively monitors run-time behaviors to optimize placements dynamically. We present a software/hardware cooperative framework, 2PP, and evaluate it with respect to state-of-the-art migratory placement, finding that it improves performance by an average of 12.1\%. Furthermore, 2PP improves energy efficiency by up to 51.8\%, and by an average of 18.4\%. It does so by reducing run-time monitoring and migration overheads.},

With the trend of greater associativity in second-level caches, implementing effective replacement algorithms might become more important than reducing conflict misses. After showing that an opportunity exists to close part of the gap between the OPT and the LRU algorithms, we present a replacement algorithm based on the detection of temporal locality in lines residing in the L2 cache. Rather than always replacing the LRU line, the victim is chosen by considering both its priority in the LRU stack and whether it exhibits temporal locality or not. We consider two strategies which use this replacement algorithm: a profile-based scheme where temporal locality is detected by processing a trace from a training set of the application and an on-line scheme, where temporal locality is detected with the assistance of a small locality table. Both schemes improve on the second-level cache miss rate over a pure LRU algorithm, by as much as 12\% in the profiling case and 20\% in the dynamic case.},

  abstract = {The L2 cache is commonly managed using LRU policy. For workloads that have a working set larger than L2 cache, LRU behaves poorly, resulting in a great number of less reused lines that are never reused or reused for few times. In this case, the cache performance can be improved through retaining a portion of working set in cache for a period long enough. Previous schemes approach this by bypassing never reused lines. Nevertheless, severely constrained by the number of never reused lines, sometimes they deliver no benefit due to the lack of never reused lines. This paper proposes a new filtering mechanism that filters out the less reused lines rather than just never reused lines. The extended scope of bypassing provides more opportunities to fit the working set into cache. This paper also proposes a Less Reused Filter (LRF), a separate structure that precedes L2 cache, to implement the above mechanism. LRF employs a reuse frequency predictor to accurately identify the less reused lines from incoming lines. Meanwhile, based on our observation that most less reused lines have a short life span, LRF places the filtered lines into a small filter buffer to fully utilize them, avoiding extra misses. Our evaluation, for 24 SPEC 2000 benchmarks, shows that augmenting a 512KB LRU-managed L2 cache with a LRF having 32KB filter buffer reduces the average MPKI by 27.5\%, narrowing the gap between LRU and OPT by 74.4\%.},

  abstract = {This in recent years, the mixed memory (PDRAM) which is consisted of the phase-change memory (PRAM) and the conventional memory (DRAM) has drawn a lot of attention from both industry and academia. It is a promising alternative to replace the traditional memory architecture. PDRAM has good characteristics as large capacity, good stability and non-volatile, while PRAM has disadvantages of a limited life and large access latency. Traditional policies are not sufficient to be directly applied to the PDRAM memory architecture. They cannot adapt to the new features of the hybrid architecture because of their undifferentiated operation, extensive use of PRAM can cause performance degradation and shorten the life of PDRAM memory. This paper proposed Hybrid-LRU caching scheme to address these problems. Our scheme mainly uses the cache consistency address resolution mode to distinguish between different physical mediums in PDRAM, and then take different actions depending on different physical mediums. We have taken a variety of tradition policies like LRU, FIFO, RANDOM, CFLRU to make experimental comparisons. The experimental results have shown that our scheme can reduce the PRAM utilization rate of 11.8\% and improve the performance by 4.6\%, energy consumption of write and read operation can be reduced up to 88.2\%.},

  abstract = {As processor performance is reaching the level of executing a single instruction in 1 ns, long memory latencies have become a critical problem, because a single memory access could stall the execution of hundreds of instructions. A recently announced channeled-DRAM approaches this problem by integrating a small low-latency buffer, called "channels", in front of a DRAM core in order to reduce the effective memory latency. Since the channels can provide intrinsically faster access than that of a bare DRAM core when they hit, key considerations in this architecture become (1) how to achieve high channel hit rates and (2) how to reduce the channel-miss latencies. Since channeled-DRAMs rely on an external memory controller to handle all the channel management, design of the memory controller heavily dominates the first issue. In this paper, we propose two novel techniques for reducing the channel-miss latencies: direct background operation and delayed channel replacement. We examined these techniques in a future 256-Mb DRAM with a 200-MHz double-data-rate (DDR) synchronous interface. Both SPICE simulation results (that show channel-miss latency reduction) and system-level simulation results (that reveal system-level performance improvement) are presented.},

  abstract = {A microprocessor integrated with DRAM on the same die has the potential to improve system performance by reducing the memory latency and improving the memory bandwidth. However a high performance microprocessor will typically send more accesses than the DRAM can handle due to the long cycle time of the embedded DRAM, especially in applications with significant memory requirements. A multi-bank DRAM can hide the long cycle time by allowing the DRAM to process multiple accesses in parallel, but it will incur a significant area penalty and will therefore restrict the density of the embedded DRAM main memory. In this paper we propose a hierarchical multi-bank DRAM architecture to achieve high system performance with a minimal area penalty. In this architecture, the independent memory banks are each divided into many semi-independent subbanks that share I/O and decoder resources. A hierarchical multi-bank DRAM with 4 main banks each composed of 32 subbanks occupies approximately the same area as a conventional 4 bank DRAM while performing like a 32 bank one-up to 65\% better than a conventional 4 bank DRAM when integrated with a single-chip multiprocessor.},

These accesses have little temporal or spatial locality, and thus incur long memory stalls and large bandwidth requirements. A traditional streaming or striding prefetcher cannot capture these irregular access patterns. A majority of these irregular accesses come from indirect patterns of the form A[B[j]]. We propose an efficient hardware indirect memory prefetcher (IMP) to capture this access pattern and hide latency. We also propose a partial cacheline accessing mechanism for these prefetches to reduce the network and DRAM bandwidth pressure from the lack of spatial locality. Evaluated on 7 applications, IMP shows 56\% speedup on average (up to 2.3√ó) compared to a baseline 64 core system with streaming prefetchers. This is within 23\% of an idealized system. With partial cacheline accessing, we see another 9.4\% speedup on average (up to 46.6\%).},

Recent proposals that improve the performance of smaller, uniprocessor caches with SPEC CPU workloads do not achieve similar benefits with commercial workloads and larger caches , even though these caches still perform worse than optimal. The recently proposed Shepherd Cache replacement policy reduces miss-ratios by 7.3\% on average, but it relies on an impractical LRU policy and requires 5.3\% overhead relative to the total cache capacity. We propose two new, practical, low-overhead replacement policies that mimic Shepherd Cache with significantly less meta-data overhead. First, we propose a Lightweight Shepherd Cache design that reduces miss-ratios by 8\% on average and up to 19\%, while requiring only 1.9\% meta-data overhead . We also propose an Extra-Lightweight Shepherd Cache design that reduces overhead to only 0.5\% when combined with a practical Clock replacement policy while reducing miss-ratios by an average of 5.4\% and up to 14\%.},

Recently proposed RRIP policy improves performance for such workloads. However, RRIP lacks of access recency information, which may confuse the replacement policy to make accurate prediction. Consequently, RRIP is not robust for recency-friendly workloads. This paper proposes an Adaptive Insertion and Re-reference Prediction (AI-RRP) policy which evicts data based on both re-reference prediction value and the access recency information. To make the replacement policy more adaptive across different workloads and different phases during execution, Dynamic AI-RRP (DAI-RRP) is proposed which adjusts the insertion position and prediction value for different access patterns. Simulation results show DAI-RRP reduces CPI over LRU and Dynamic RRIP by an average of 8.3\% and 4.1\% respectively on a single-core processor with a 1MB 16-way set last-level cache (LLC). Evaluations on quad-core CMP with a 4MB shared LLC show that DAI-RRP outperforms LRU and Dynamic RRIP (DRRIP) on the weighted speedup metric by an average of 13.2\% and 26.7\% respectively. Furthermore, compred to LRU, DAI-RRP requires similar hardware, or even less hardware for high-associativity cache.},

  abstract = {The widely used LRU replacement policy suffers from the following problems. First, LRU does not exploit fre-quency information of cache accesses. Second, LRU may experience cache thrashing when access to cache exhibits cyclic patterns and the cache capacity is less than the working set. Finally, LRU is expensive to implement in hardware. We propose a bubble replacement for low-level caches, where cache blocks in one set are arranged in a queue for replacement determination. An incoming block enters the queue from the bottom and exchanges its posi-tion with the block above when the block hits, therefore, both recency and frequency information of a program are exploited. A victim block can be chosen from either the bottom or the top block of the queue, which is controlled by a single-bit set-hit flag per set. Choosing the bottom block as the victim makes the bubble replacement resistant to less frequently used blocks from polluting the cache while choosing the top block as the victim makes the bub-ble replacement adaptable to changes in the working set. We also propose to divide the blocks in a cache set into groups where each group implements the bubble replace-ment (we name it the DC-Bubble) to resolve the problems of the bubble replacement. The victim block is chosen ran-domly from the bottom block of each group. The proposed DC-Bubble reduces the average MPKI of the baseline 1MB 16-way L2 cache by 14\%, bridges 47\% of the gap between LRU and the OPT, reduces the storage require-ment by 61\% and simplifies the circuit design compared to LRU.},

To improve the memory system utilization and meet a wide range of bandwidth and latency requirements of these FUs, a well-designed memory scheduler that takes the quality-of-service (QoS) into account must be adopted. In this paper, a laxity-aware memory scheduler that can adaptively measure the laxity of each memory access task is proposed. Known the laxity of each memory access task, the proposed memory scheduler can guarantee the necessary bandwidth within a certain time interval, which is crucial to the performance and user experience of multimedia SoCs. Compared to previous proposed memory scheduling algorithms based on bandwidth allocating, the laxity-aware memory scheduler can obtain 14.5\% decrease in memory access latency while preserving high DRAM data bus utilization.},

However, recent research efforts on improving replacement policies require either significant additional hardware or major modifications to the organization of the existing cache. In this study, we propose the PAC-PLRU cache replacement policy. PAC-PLRU not only utilizes but also judiciously salvages the prediction information discarded from a widely-adopted stride prefetcher. The main idea behind PAC-PLRU is utilizing the prediction results generated by the existing stride prefetcher and preventing these predicted cache blocks from being replaced in the near future. Experimental results show that leveraging the PAC-PLRU with a stride prefetcher reduces the average L2 cache miss rate by 91\% over a baseline system with only PLRU policy, and by 22\% over a system using PLRU with an unconnected stride prefetcher. Most importantly, PAC-PLRU only requires minor modifications to existing cache architecture to get these benefits. The proposed PAC-PLRU policy is promising in fostering the connection between prefetching and replacement policies, and have a lasting impact on improving the overall cache performance.},

Most architectures use set-associative caches with LRU replacement policies to combine fast access with relatively low miss rates. To improve replacement decisions in set-associative caches, we develop a new set of compiler algorithms that predict which data will and will not be reused and provide these hints to the architecture. We prove that the hints either match or improve hit rates over LRU. We describe a practical one-bit cache-line tag implementation of our algorithm, called evict-me. On a cache replacement, the architecture will replace a line for which the evict-me bit is set, or if none is set, it will use the LRU bits. We implement our compiler analysis and its output in the Scale compiler. On a variety of scientific programs, using the evict-me algorithm in both the level 1 and 2 caches improves simulated cycle times by up to 34\% over the LRU policy by increasing hit rates. In addition, a combination of simple hardware prefetching and evict-me works together to further improve performance.},

  abstract = {This paper offers afresh perspective on the problem of predicting and optimizing memory behavior. We show quantitatively the extent to which detailed timing characteristics of past memory reference events are strongly predictive of future program reference behavior. We propose a family of timekeeping techniques that optimize behavior based on observations about particular cache time durations, such as the cache access interval or the cache dead time. Timekeeping techniques can be used to build small, simple, and high-accuracy (often 90\% or more) predictors for identifying conflict misses, for predicting dead blocks, and even for estimating the time at which the next reference to a cache frame will occur and the address that will be accessed. Based on these predictors, we demonstrate two new and complementary time-based hardware structures: (1) a time-based victim cache that improves performance by only storing conflict miss lines with likely reuse, and (2) a time-based prefetching technique that hones in on the right address to prefetch, and the right time to schedule the prefetch.},

  abstract = {Although many block replacement algorithms for buffer caches have been proposed to address the well-known drawbacks of the LRU algorithm, they are not robust and cannot maintain a consistent performance improvement over all workloads. This paper proposes a novel and simple replacement scheme, called the Robust Adaptive buffer Cache management schemE (RACE), which differentiates the locality of I/O streams by actively detecting access patterns that are inherently exhibited in two correlated spaces, that is, the discrete block space of program contexts from which I/O requests are issued and the continuous block space within files to which I/O requests are addressed. This scheme combines the global I/O regularities of an application and the local I/O regularities of individual files that are accessed in that application to accurately estimate the locality strength, which is crucial in deciding which blocks are to be replaced upon a cache miss. Through comprehensive simulations on 10 real-application traces, RACE is shown to have higher hit ratios than LRU and all other state-of-the-art cache management schemes studied in this paper.},
